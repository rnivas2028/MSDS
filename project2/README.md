Project 2
Identify a large 2-node network datasetâ€”you can start with a dataset in a repository.  Your data should meet the criteria that it consists of ties between and not within two (or more) distinct groups.
Reduce the size of the network using a method such as the island method described in chapter 4 of social network analysis.
What can you infer about each of the distinct groups?
