"Reuters  @media screen and (max-device-width: 480px){body{ font-size:30pt !important;}}    By Anna Irrera and Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi NEW YORK/ZURICH, July 19 (Reuters) - Swiss regulators are stepping up efforts to halt an exodus of cryptocurrency projects from the country, after two of only a handful of banks active in the nascent sector shut their doors on it in the last year. The departures, which industry sources fear will continue, mean Switzerland is losing business to offshore rivals including Liechtenstein, Gibraltar and the Cayman Islands, where banks are more welcoming.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','',''); The wealthy Swiss canton of Zug, for example, has been dubbed ""Crypto Valley"", with 200-300 virtual currency entities opening there in recent years. Zug's finance director, Heinz Taennler, says they may leave if the government does not take steps to give them access to the banking system, without which they struggle to function. ""All their banking relationships are going to Liechtenstein,"" he told Reuters. ""These are hundreds of jobs that have been created, and every job is important."" Thomas Moser, an alternate member of the governing board at the Swiss National Bank (SNB), said some cryptocurrency companies had asked the central to intervene. ""They raised concerns about problems with opening bank accounts, which was a worry for them, and asked for help,"" Moser told Reuters. ""I said this was not something the SNB dealt with, but they should speak with FINMA. FINMA, Switzerland's financial market supervisor, has held discussions with the SNB and bankers' association on how to make banks more accessible to cryptocurrency ventures. ""We would not want to close the door on the opportunities that such innovation (cryptocurrencies) might bring,"" Moser added. Providing the legal framework to launch ICOs and for banks to do business with cryptocurrency companies is not easy. The risk of fraud and lack of transparency about who owns cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether have made regulators around the world wary. The United States is among countries that are increasing scrutiny of the sector.   BANKS WARY Swiss banks are urging the authorities to give them more clarity on the rules that apply to cryptocurrency projects before providing services to the market, and at least two important players have withdrawn for now. Zuercher Kantonalbank (ZKB), the fourth largest Swiss bank and one of the few big banks in the world to welcome issuers of cryptocurrencies, has closed the accounts of more than 20 companies in the last year, industry sources told Reuters. A spokesman for ZKB declined to comment on any former or existing clients relationships, but said the bank does not do business with any cryptocurrency groups. Another large Swiss bank kicked out crypto project Smart Valor at around the same time, said a person familiar with the project. The source declined to name the bank. Only a handful of Switzerland's 250 banks ever allowed companies to deposit the cash equivalent of cryptocurrencies raised in ICOs. At least two still do, Reuters has established. But the involvement of a large bank like ZKB helped to establish Switzerland as an early cryptocurrency hub. ZKB and the bank that turned its back on Smart Valor began shutting their doors in October after a management feud severely damaged cryptocurrency project Tezos, which had conducted Zug's largest ICO, entrepreneurs and advisers said.  Swiss banks are worried because some companies that carried out ICOs did not do anti-money laundering (AML) checks on their contributors, industry sources said. This means the banks themselves could fall foul of AML rules.   LIECHTENSTEIN A WINNER ""A cautionary response from Swiss banks resulted in a pause or closure for most projects in the cryptocurrency space,""  said David Henderson, founder of the Swiss Sweetbridge Foundation, set up to conduct blockchain startup Sweetbridge's ICO. Sweetbridge was in the late stages of securing an account with ZKB, but the application was put on hold a few days after the Tezos scandal erupted, Henderson said. The project ultimately decided not to carry out its planned ICO through the Swiss foundation, setting up entities and bank accounts in Gibraltar and Liechtenstein instead. It is difficult for crypto-projects to use the funds they raise through ICOs if they are locked out of the banking system. Funds from ICOs are often originally raised in cryptocurrencies bitcoin and ether, which have limited use as a means of payment in the broader economy. ""I cannot pay salaries because our money is caught up there. We cannot move it,"" said the founder of a Swiss crypto-firm which has had accounts closed at three different banks. The banks have asked the firm to take out its money, but it is unable to do so without first finding another banking relationship, the founder added. At least two Swiss banks are still accepting ICO funds, according to checks by Reuters. These are Banca Zarattini, a small bank in the Italian-language canton Ticino, and Hypothekarbank Lenzburg, a regional lender located between Zurich and Basel, which recently began accepting crypto customers. Banca Zarattini only banks ICO companies with KYC (know-your-customer) and AML procedures that are in compliance with Swiss law, it said. Hypothekarbank Lenzburg said it had started to accept crytocurrency companies and could charge an initial assessment fee of up to 2,500 Swiss francs($2,500). Bank Frick in Liechtenstein has become a popular alternative for Swiss entities struggling to secure accounts. It banks around 160 crypto-enterprises or projects, of which 60 are in the process of setting up an ICO, the bank told Reuters. The bank, however, declined 90 percent of account requests from cryptocurrency companies and only accepts ICOs based onshore in Switzerland or Liechtenstein, it said.   RULES AND REASSURANCES Despite the challenges, Switzerland is working on new rules to reassure banks and encourage them to accept the accounts of cryptocurrency companies. The country has dropped from second place in 2017 to sixth this year in a country ranking of the sum of ICO funds raised,  according to a study published by PwC and the Crypto Valley Association in June. The Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands topped the list. In May, Swiss Finance Minister Ueli Maurer invited FINMA, the central bank and the Swiss Bankers Association (SBA) to a roundtable discussion on bank accounts for cryptocurrencies. After the meeting, the SBA set up a working group to compile a set of checks and conditions that all banks could follow when opening an account for cryptocurrency firms. ""Banks are currently hesitant to open business accounts for companies with particular touchpoints to ICOs and cryptocurrencies - due to risks such as fraud or money laundering,"" SBA said in a statement. Zug finance director Taennler said the aim set out during the meeting, which he attended, was to have a set of FINMA-approved guidelines for assessing prospective cryptocurrency clients by the year-end. FINMA has already issued separate guidelines to spell out how Swiss AML rules and securities regulations apply to various ICOs. But securities rules are less stringent in Switzerland than in the United States, where the Securities and Exchange Commission has toughened its stance on ICOs.  This makes it more risky for banks in Switzerland to be involved with ICO projects which may have raised money from U.S. contributors and could fall under the purview of the SEC. Switzerland's authorities have said they want to create conditions for the country to remain competitive but with no room for scams or financial crime. The finance ministry is also looking at the broader legal framework for blockchain technology and ICOs. Its findings will be presented to the federal government by the end of the year and will determine how the technology fits into existing Swiss laws and regulations.

"    When you were a young'un, your parents may have sat you down   to talk about the ""birds and the bees."" Now it's time to turn the   tables and address another uncomfortable topic: their   finances. Such conversations mark a reversal in the traditional   parent-child dynamic, and also can be fraught with concerns over   independence, trust and mortality. As a result, these talks often   don't happen at all, and a perceived lack of urgency is to blame,   according to a 2018 survey conducted by Wells Fargo. Roughly one-third of parents over the age of 60 say they've   never discussed later-life needs with family, including   inheritance plans, beneficiaries, important documents or   designated representatives, according to the survey. Meanwhile,   adult children worry such conversations will cause conflict or   make it seem as though they're after their parents' money.makeArticleAd(); As daunting as it may seem, it's important to have ""the talk""   about finances with your parents to help protect them from scams   and elder abuse, which cost Americans more than $36 billion each   year, according to financial services firm True Link Financial.   These conversations also ensure that a rapid-response plan is in   place in the event of disability and that there are no surprises   after your parents die, says Ron Long, head of regulatory affairs   and elder client initiatives at Wells Fargo Advisors. These four tips can open lines of communication. 1. Start with one conversation When's a good time to sit your parents down for a hard   conversation about their financial well-being, plans for the   future and important legal and financial documents like a will,   power of attorney or health care directives? The twelfth of   never, for most children. Don't wait for tragedy to strike. A study by Ameriprise   Financial found that a life-altering incident was the trigger for   90% of children who'd actually discussed estate planning with   their parents.  » Unfamiliar with estate planning?     See our   7-step checklist  Instead, carve out time for a family meeting - perhaps on   Mother's Day, Father's Day or the Friday after Thanksgiving -   when all the children are present, Long recommends. ""It's a good   way to get the conversation started and then you can do a   refresher or update down the road."" The first conversation should serve as a door-opener. There   are weighty decisions at play - which may change over time with   your parents' mental or physical health - so don't expect a   one-and-done conversation. 2. Begin with the basics Talking about money inspires reactions ranging from secretive   to forthright. Even if your parents aren't particularly prickly   about discussing their finances, it's prudent to ease into such   conversations. Long says a strategy that's ""very helpful"" is approaching   discussions from a group-planning perspective - sharing what   end-of-life goals you're considering and asking your parents   about theirs. ""Remember, these are subjects that a lot of older   folks hold close to their hearts,"" he says. Be sensitive when starting that initial conversation. Think   less interrogative (how much money's at stake and who gets what?)   and more collaborative (exchanging information about where   accounts are held or who has power of attorney). 3. Broach serious topics Once you've established a rapport, tackle topics that make   either you or your parents uncomfortable, including the morose   (funeral arrangements or declining health) and the dangerous   (financial scams targeting seniors that could wipe out their   savings). Don't let the prospect of an awkward conversation now create a   bigger headache in the future. Strive for this balance:   confronting reality head-on without infantilizing or offending   your parents. A bad way to deal? Shutting down future   conversations when talks are strained. A better way to deal?   Involving other family members to facilitate discussion or   working with a financial advisor to handle trickier topics. (Here   are some tips on   choosing a financial advisor    .) 4. Leave judgment at the door Conversations with your parents may reveal wildly different   opinions about how to handle finances. You're asking them to part   with sensitive information; promise a judgment-free zone in   return. Because of the prevalence of financial abuse - it's estimated   one in five elders have been impacted - urge your parents to flag   potential scams.

"   makeZacksArticleAd();Though Trump's protectionist stance and the resultant trade tension has been playing foul on the stock market, American stocks have been showing momentum lately with the S&P 500 index climbing to the highest level in more than five months. The impressive run has been credited to robust earnings and strengthening economy.   This is especially true as Q2 earnings from about 10% companies on the S&P 500 that have reported so far are up 23% on 10% higher revenues. The proportion of these companies beating EPS and revenue estimates is tracking above other recent periods. As a whole, earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to grow 20.4% from the same period last year on 8.3% higher revenues. This would be the third consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth, a trend that is currently expected to continue in the second half of the year. A strong economy and historic tax cuts will continue to drive earnings higher.   Additionally, the Fed Chairman's testimony, which reaffirmed the central bank's plans to gradually increase interest rates, added to the strength. Powell painted an optimistic view of the economy, citing that America is expanding at a faster pace. Robust job gains, rise in income and optimism among households have lifted consumer spending in recent months and will likely continue doing so. Unemployment rate is below 4% and inflation is running above the Fed's 2% target for the first time in several years.   All these developments are strong enough to justify continued interest rate increases. The Fed has raised rates twice this year in quarter-point increments and is expected to implement two more lift-offs by the end of this year.

"     OPKO Health, Inc.  's OPK  partner Vifor Fresenius Medical Care Renal Pharma (""VFMCRP"") recently received approval from Health Canada to market RAYALDEE in the country. Following the announcement, the company's shares climbed 4% to close at $6.29. In the past six months, shares of OPKO Health have rallied 40.7% against the industry  's decline of 19.2%.    The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Coming back to the news, this development will enable treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (""SHPT"") in adults with stage 3 or 4 chronic kidney disease (""CKD"") in Canada. The Kidney Foundation of Canada states that about 4 million Canadians live with CKD, of which 3,000 Canadians succumb to it each year. Thus, the latest regulatory approval will ensure that more patients have access to the benefits of OPKO Health's flagship RAYALDEE.  RAYALDEE at a Glance  RAYALDEE is OPKO Health's leading renal product in the U.S. market. Launched in 2016, it is the first and only product which received approval from the FDA for treating SHPT. In the last reported quarter, the company recognized $3.7 million of revenues from the sale of RAYALDEE. Total RAYALDEE prescriptions skyrocketed 730% on a year-over-year basis and improved 38% from the sequential quarter's tally. Furthermore, OPKO Health invested $7.3 million in the RAYALDEE commercial organization in the first quarter.  Market Prospects  According to a Global Info Research study, the worldwide market for CKD is expected to see a CAGR of roughly 4.1% over the next five years, reaching $15800 million in 2023, from $12400 million in 2017. Per an article by Mordor Intelligence, the global renal medical devices and services market is expected to see a CAGR of about 6% between 2018 and 2023. Increasing prevalence of diabetes and a growing aging population worldwide are driving the market. The study further states that North America and Europe are likely to account for the largest share of the market. Hence, the latest development has been a timely and strategic one for OPKO Health.

"    With a market capitalization of approximately $3.28 billion, Opko Health, Inc  . OPK  has been riding high on solid prospects in RAYLDEE and BioReference platforms. The company's consistent focus in R&D bodes well. However, the company faces cutthroat competition in the niche space. The company has been incurring operating losses due to limited revenues from the pharmaceutical operations and sale of the 4Kscore test. For 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $260.4 million, reflecting a decline of 17.1% year over year. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 is pegged at a loss of 7 cents. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Here we take a quick look at the primary factors that have been plaguing Opko Health and discuss the prospects that ensure near-term recovery.  Opko Health, Inc. Price and Consensus         Opko Health, Inc. Price and Consensus    |      Opko Health, Inc. Quote   What's Deterring Opko Health?   Infamous History Operating Losses  The company has an unimpressive record of incurring huge operating losses. Till date, it has generated only limited revenues from the pharmaceutical operations in the United States, Chile, Mexico, Israel, Spain and Ireland as well as from the sale of the 4Kscore test. The company persistently incurs substantial research and development (R&D) as well as general and administrative expenses related to operations. Per management, Opko Health allocated most of its financial resources to R&D, including pre-clinical development activities and clinical trials, which dampened margins. Management is also apprehensive about difficulties in cash flow and profit generation in the recently-launched BioReference and other commercial businesses. In the first quarter of 2018, operating expenses amounted to $124.4 million, down 8.9% on a year-over-year basis. Notably, Opko Health incurred an operating loss of $42.6 million, down from $45.2 million in the prior-year quarter.  Cutthroat Competition in the Niche Space  The medical instrument industry is highly competitive. The industry calls for extensive research for technological innovation continuously. Competitors of the diagnostics business include major diagnostic companies, reference laboratories, molecular diagnostic firms, universities and research institutions. We believe that most of these companies are financially stronger than Opko Health with larger research and development staffs along with more extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations. The strength of these companies is likely to dent Opko Health's customer base in the quarters to come.  Why Should You Still Hold?   RAYALDEE Gains Prominence  Within the pharmaceutical business, RAYALDEE is Opko Health's leading renal product in the domestic market since the last two years. RAYALDEE is the first and only therapy approved by the FDA for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in adults with stage 3 or 4 chronic kidney disease. RAYALDEE has been witnessing a decent momentum, courtesy of successful efforts from the sales team. In the first quarter of 2018, Opko Health registered $3.7 million of revenues related to sales of RAYALDEE. Total RAYALDEE prescriptions surged approximately 730% on a year-over-year basis and improved 38% from the sequential quarter's tally. Opko Health invested $7.3 million in the RAYALDEE commercial organization in the first quarter.  Solid R&D Focus  Opko Health's strong focus in R&D is a positive factor. The company's strong commitment toward innovation led to the introduction of several products, improvements in the existing products and expansion of product lines as well as enhancements and new equipment in the R&D facilities. Opko Health's R&D expenses were approximately $125.2 million, $111.2 million and $99.5 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. In the first quarter of 2018, expenses totaled $34.2 million, up 23.9% year over year. By the end of the quarter, the company confirmed to make solid investments in R&D activities in the upcoming quarters.  Solid Guidance  In the second quarter of 2018, Opko Health expects revenues from services in the range of $205-$225 million. Product revenues are expected in the range of $25-$30 million, including RAYALDEE revenues that are projected in the band of $4-$5 million. Revenues from the transfer of intellectual property are projected between $15 million and $20 million. Operating expenses are expected to be in line with the first quarter's projection of $295-$310 million. For 2018, effective tax rate is projected to be in single digits.  Price Performance  Shares of Opko Health have outperformed the industry in a month's time. Notably, the company's shares have gained 36.2% against the industry  's decline of 10%. The current level is also higher than the S&P 500 index's rise of 1%.

"Even though volatility has made a strong comeback in the stock   market this year, the overall returns of the   S&P 500    have been par for the course: 4.8% -- including dividends -- as   of this writing. That's slightly ahead of the historical norm for   six months, but nothing to write home about. A group of growth stocks, however, have far surpassed those   returns, averaging more than a double in six months. How have   these stocks pulled off the feat, and which have risen the   most?makeArticleAd();   Image source: Getty Images. Before diving into the numbers, a quick word about the stocks   included in this article. All of the companies needed to have a   market capitalization of at least $1 billion at the start of the   year -- this eliminates micro-cap stocks that experienced huge   swings and are difficult to safely invest in due to little   trading liquidity. All five have also averaged sales growth of at   least 15% per year over the past few years. This helps   differentiate ""value"" stocks that were   attractively priced from true ""growth"" stocks    . Etsy: Up 115% Who says that a small e-commerce start-up can't challenge the   entrenched industry heavyweights? While   Etsy    (NASDAQ: ETSY) stock had a ton of trouble out of the gate -- it   lost almost 70% of its value in its first year as a publicly   traded company -- it has since impressed the markets with its   staying power. The company brought in a new executive team after the poor   post-IPO showing, and   things have been encouraging ever since    . By growing gross merchandise sold, focusing the company's   scope, and trimming the payrolls, the company has produced   results far ahead of what most analysts have expected. The stock's   biggest pop    came just last month, when Etsy posted solid revenue growth   and announced a new premium tier of subscription membership   and -- most importantly -- an increase in fees for items sold on   the platform. The company has been able to accomplish this even with heavy   turnover in it's base of sellers. Over the last three years,   active sellers increased 40%, but there's heavy churn: only 32%   of active sellers from 2014 were still active at the end of last   year. The real growth hook has been the Seller Services division --   which is where investors should train their attention. This helps   vendors manage payments, promote their listings, print shipping   labels, and design their websites. Revenue from the program is   booming -- up over 200% in the past three years, it accounted for   59% of revenue at the end of 2017. Netflix: Up 115% While it's not uncommon to see a small-cap stock like Etsy   make a six-month double, it's very uncommon to see a large cap   like   Netflix    (NASDAQ: NFLX) do the same. Then again, Netflix is an uncommon   company. In January, founder and CEO Reed Hastings   announced huge subscriber gains    . Domestic subscribers jumped 11% year over year to 55 million,   while international subscriptions were even more impressive: up   42% to 63 million. The key was that this growth came on the heels   of an increase in the subscription price -- showing that people   are willing to pay incrementally more for Netflix and its   original content. The company followed that report up in late April with   another quarter    of impressive subscriber gains. That combined with continued   increases in monthly fees for a 43% jump in revenue for the   quarter. That type of strength -- coupled with the company's   commitment to drawing customers into the ecosystem with original   content -- led Wall Street to continue bidding shares up. Abiomed: Up 117% It should be   no surprise    to see a medical-device company in the mix. Such companies can   often get a huge boost in a short time from increased adoption of   a new product. In   Abiomed    's (NASDAQ: ABMD) case, the jump is even more impressive because   the company isn't some small start-up: It's worth over $15   billion and has been making implantable heart pumps for over 20   years. The stock had been on a steady climb throughout the year but   got its   biggest boost    in May, when the company announced revenue from its Impella heart   pumps jumped 42% during the quarter. The pumps help support   patients undergoing procedures that might otherwise not be   possible because of heart conditions. Because of the popularity of these pumps with hospitals   throughout the world, Abiomed's free cash flow has jumped 260%   over the past three years to $137 million. Sarepta Therapeutics: Up 145% After years of no real sales to speak of,   Sarepta Therapeutics    (NASDAQ: SRPT) has seen sales skyrocket. That has been   almost solely    due to the success of RNA-targeted Duchenne muscular dystrophy   (DMD) thearpy. But that doesn't actually account for all of the gains in   Sarepta's stock. The lift has come from exciting news from the   company's gene-editing therapies under development. In late June,   the stock jumped over 65% in a single day after Sarepta   announced positive results    from an experimental gene therapy to treat DMD. But investors need to keep a close eye on the exact data   coming from these gene therapies. As fellow Fool Todd Campbell   highlights    , Sarepta's exciting data came from a pool of just three   patients. That pool of trial participants will soon grow to 12   individuals. If Sarepta's DMD gene-editing therapy can perform   just as well, it would be a huge boon -- as there are few   treatments on the market for DMD. Investors need to realize, as with all early stage drug   companies, that the stock can be extremely volatile. While   positive results have create huge pops, if the next trial doesn't   produce the same type of excitement, the stock could quickly   crater. Axon Enterprise: Up 149% Finally, we have   Axon Enterprise    (NASDAQ: AAXN) -- the company formerly known as TASER   International. While it still manufactures -- and has experienced   significant contributions from -- its stun guns,   it has turned its focus to body cameras    . Specifically, the Evidence.com platform for storing and   analyzing body camera footage has proven to be a sticky source of   reliable revenue. Early in the year, founder and CEO Rick Smith announced that   he would be forgoing an annual salary in favor of an   Elon Musk-like package    -- he'll get paid only if the stock advances significantly. That, combined with impressive gains from Evidence.com, Axon's   acquisition of its only real rival in body   cameras    , and a   slate of new products    that could prove very popular with police departments, has helped   the stock boom after years of so-so performance. Moving forward, there are two critically important metrics for   investors to watch: the number of cumulative seats booked on   Evidence.com (it's currently at 226,900), and the roll out of the   company's Records Management System (RMS) and its adoption by   police departments.  If things go well, the former should   continue growing briskly, while the latter may take time -- until   early 2019 -- to gain a foothold in departments.  The best stocks in the second half of 2018?  Of course, there's no guarantee that these stocks will still   be on the list of successful growth stocks at the end of 2018.   Sarepta especially can be extremely volatile -- based upon the   success and approval of its DMD gene-editing drug. It would be very difficult to imagine a scenario where the   rest of the companies' underlying businesses suffer in the second   half of the year. For instance, I don't see Netflix subscriber   rolls, or Abiomed heart pumps ordered, or Etsy vendor sales, or   Evidence.com bookings falling off of a cliff. That should be heartening for investors. At the same time,   however, that doesn't mean the   stocks    can't fall. All of these companies have enjoyed solid gains and   are richly valued. If you're putting money behind them, make sure   that it's for more than just the next six months -- that's the   only way to ensure that you'll truly get the benefits that come   with being a long-term investor in solid businesses.   10 stocks we like better than Netflix       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Further, in support of its European customers, the company initiated the production of Inogen One G3 concentrators in 2017 using a contract manufacturer, Foxconn, in the Czech Republic. In 2018, the company expects Foxconn to produce the vast majority of the Inogen One G3 concentrators to meet the European demand. In the first quarter of 2018, Europe represented 89.5% of international sales, up from 73.2% in the year-ago quarter. The company's European partners significantly contributed to business-to-business sales. The company expects to see modest growth in international sales in the rest of 2018 and maintain focus on Europe. Notably, Foxconn has been producing the G3 products to cater to the European demand. This has also led to the signing of an additional lease for 23,000 toward fee increased footprint, which provides scope for expansion.  Solid Guidance  Buoyed by impressive first-quarter results, Inogen raised outlook for 2018. The company projects revenues in the range of $310-$320 million, indicating growth of 24.3-28.3% on a year-over-year basis. Direct-to-consumer is expected to be the fastest growing channel for the company. Net income guidance for 2018 is projected in the range of $38-$41 million, up from $36-$39 million and representing growth of 80.9-95.2% year over year.  Impressive Product Portfolio  Inogen's expanding product portfolio is a key catalyst. The company provides oxygen concentrator solutions for portable and stationary use. Inogen's flagship product, One G4, is a single-solution portable oxygen concentrator (POC). Further, Inogen One G3 portable oxygen concentrator provides mobility and independence to oxygen therapy users. This platform is the lightest continuous flow oxygen concentrator in the market and consumes much less power than its competitive devices.

"   Not all that long ago, a Nasdaq listing of a stock was met with a bit of derision. While it wasn't as lowly as the ""pink sheets,"" the up-and-coming exchange - which was more of a telecommunications network and less of an actual trading floor - just didn't have street cred. Thus, Nasdaq stocks weren't taken as seriously as the tickers associated with the New York Stock Exchange.But a funny thing happened as the 1990s turned into the 2000s. Largely thanks to the explosive growth of Microsoft ( MSFT ) and Apple ( AAPL ) - both of which were listed on the Nasdaq exchange - the little tech-heavy exchange began to be recognized as the place where investors could participate in the technology evolution.makeArticleAd();The rest, as they say, is history.Little has changed in the meantime. The Nasdaq still is a technology-oriented exchange, and still home to some of the stock market's most rewarding names. So rewarding, in fact, that they have driven the Nasdaq composite to numerous fresh highs in 2018.Here's a rundown of 10 of the most compelling Nasdaq stocks. Some are familiar, some not so much. In all cases, though, these companies offer something special their peers don't.SEE ALSO: 25 Stocks Every Retiree Should OwnMKS InstrumentsMarket value: $5.4 billionMost investors might not be familiar with MKS Instruments ( MKSI , $97.95), but Wall Street analysts certainly are, and they love what they see. It's one of the few Nasdaq stocks the professionals rater better than a buy, leaning toward a strong buy - the highest possible rating. Better still, the average analyst price target of $137 is a whopping 40% higher than the stock's current price.In May, Citi went so far as to name MKSI as its top mid-cap/small-cap in the technology fabrication equipment space.MKS Instruments, as the name suggests, makes a variety of scientific instruments. From optical gas analysis to pressure measurement to motion control, the company makes solutions the average consumer couldn't care less about - but that the average manufacturer can't live without.The results underscore that demand. MKS Instruments is expected to grow revenues by 14% this year, and the bottom line should expand at an even faster pace. For the record, MKSI has topped estimates in most of its recent quarters, by a lot.The kicker: With MKSI priced at less than 14 times trailing earnings and a forward-looking price-to-earnings ratio of about 10, MKSI is an unusual bargain amid technology stocks.SEE ALSO: The ""Sweet Spot"": 15 Mid-Cap Dividend Stocks to BuyAbiomedMarket value: $18.4 billionIf MKS Instruments is a growth machine, Abiomed ( ABMD , $414.61) is a growth factory. The company's revenues are expected to grow 29% this year, then at the same clip in 2019. Profits are even more peppy; last year's per-share profit of $2.45 is projected to reach $3.55 this year, then swell to $4.77 next year.Abiomed is the maker of a medical device that's earned the accolade ""game changer."" Its lineup of heart pumps, branded under the name Impella, are not only the smallest heart pumps in the world, but also one of the most technologically advanced. In February, the FDA approved an upgrade to the Impella CP, adding an optical pressure sensor to the device that makes it more effective and create more information about a patient's heart for caregivers.ABMD shares aren't cheap. The stock's 191% rally over the past 12 months has driven shares to a frothy valuation; even with strong earnings growth on tap, the forward P/E of 87 is tough to swallow. But this might be a case where the hype and potential of the Impella device, three years down the road, still puts it among Nasdaq stocks you should add to your watchlist.SEE ALSO: 7 ""Strong Buy"" Stock Picks for Breakneck GrowthNasdaq Inc.Market value: $15.6 billionHere's an appropriate coincidence: The exchange where many great-but-overlooked stocks trade is a great investment in and of itself.The company is simply called Nasdaq Inc. ( NDAQ , $93.37), and it's not just focused on its U.S. exchange. Nasdaq operates more than 90 markets in 50 different countries, serving as the middleman for stocks, options, futures, commodities and more.That diverse revenue stream doesn't make Nasdaq immune to economic ebbs and flows. It's a small, inter-related world, and an economic cold contracted anywhere in the world can be felt everywhere else. Nevertheless, that diversity smooths out some of the rough edges.That's not even the clincher. The reason investors may want to step into Nasdaq is, for all the fear that seems and sounds prevalent about stocks right now, young companies still are hungry for funding, and investors still are hungry for new opportunities. Both parties are coming to Nasdaq to make it happen, more than ever. The exchange added 151 new listings during the first half of this year, and as of the end of the second quarter, Nasdaq has been the IPO leader for 18 consecutive months. More listings mean more fee revenue.As long as the global economy continues to move forward, Nasdaq has an edge.SEE ALSO: 9 Tech Stocks That Sit Atop the MountainLam ResearchMarket value: $28.1 billionThe prospects of an all-out trade war between China and the United States have terrified investors. They've been particularly haunting for technology investors because disputes about intellectual property have been particularly tense. In short, both countries have been increasingly hesitant to let the other have access to certain pieces of critical hardware.Lam Research ( LRCX , $171.32), however, may not be as vulnerable to the geopolitical spat as it might seem.Moody's Senior Vice President Richard Lane made the call in late June, flatly noting, ""China's tariffs and/or trade restrictions would have only a limited impact on Applied Materials Inc., Lam Research Corp. and KLA-Tencor Corp., since indigenous Chinese customers represent just 6%, or $1.8 billion, of their annual aggregate revenue."" Lane also said non-Chinese customers will drive plenty of revenue for these outfits for the foreseeable future.Lam Research, by the way, isn't so much a technology maker as it is a company that allows more conventional tech companies make their wares. Its wafer fabrication equipment , for instance, allows chipmakers such as Intel ( INTC ) and Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) to make ever-better computing solutions.It's still subject to the cyclical nature of technology, but much less so than other technology players. The race among chipmakers to offer the fastest, smallest chips never really stops, setting the stage for consistent revenue.SEE ALSO: Trade War? These Stocks Will Do BestCanadian SolarMarket value: $765.1 millionThe solar-power investing movement mostly fell off the radar a few years back, following a frenzied 2008 that turned many of the industry's publicly traded companies into temporary heroes. That's especially true of Canadian solar panel makers such as Canadian Solar ( CSIQ , $13.06), which doesn't enjoy the benefit of being squarely in U.S. investors' sights.Solar isn't fading into the background, nor will it become just a footnote in the world's history of energy. A projected 104 gigawatts worth of solar power production capacity should be installed this year, with similar installations expected every year through 2022.Canadian Solar - one of the survivors of solar's post-2008 headwind - may well be the proverbial gold standard in the business. Not only is it still innovating, creating wares like more efficient bifacial panels, but it's also doing development deals with partners that should theoretically be making their own panels. Case in point: Japan's Yamaguchi Shin Mine solar power project tapped Canadian Solar as the supplier of the panels used in the 56-megawatt facility.The distant future rarely looks all that bright for Canadian Solar (or its peers). Prospects tend to turn into buyers on a last-minute basis, however, setting the stage for significant long-term, even if uneven, revenue and income growth. Analysts are looking for 25% sales growth this year .SEE ALSO: The 7 Highest-Rated Dividend AristocratsAdobeMarket value: $124.8 billionThink Adobe ( ADBE , $248.12) is just the company that pioneered the Portable Document Format (PDF), making it easy for web users to view and handle identical copies of documents? Think again. Adobe's Acrobat is arguably the least important piece of its portfolio now. Adobe is a full-blown digital marketing company, with some pretty impressive tools to offer current and prospective customers.Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi explains, ""While Adobe was not the first mover in marketing software (now dubbed Experience Cloud), an argument can be made that it is the leader."" He adds, ""While we believe there are some companies whose needs may not align with Adobe's marketing value proposition, we think there is plenty of room for multiple large-scale winners in the marketing cloud, with Adobe having an inside track.""The fiscal numbers agree with that thesis. Analysts collectively expect sales to soar to the tune of 22% this year , followed by 19% growth next year. Profits are expected to grow at an even faster clip. (And for the record, Adobe hasn't missed a single quarterly earnings estimate in the past three years.)ADBE shares aren't cheap, at 33 times next year's expected earnings. But you have to pay for quality.SEE ALSO: 8 Tech Stocks That Pay You to Own ThemMicrosoftMarket value: $800.5 billionMicrosoft ( MSFT , $101.98) needs no introduction or explanation. The software giant was the heart and soul of the advent of the personal computer, and then the internet itself. While the introduction of mobile devices - and mobile internet in particular - has since made Microsoft's software less relevant than it used to be, the company has reinvented itself into something perhaps even more marketable than it used to be.The reinvented Microsoft is a cloud-centric company. Although the company doesn't pinpoint exactly how much revenue that cloud computing generates, last quarter, Office 365 (its legacy productivity software, in a cloud-based subscription format) for commercial clients saw revenue growth of 14%. The consumer-oriented version helped drive 12% growth in that arm's cloud revenue. Microsoft Azure, which is the company's enterprise-level cloud platform, saw a 93% year-over-year improvement in sales a quarter ago.It's also noteworthy that as of the first quarter, Microsoft eclipsed Amazon.com ( AMZN ) in terms of cloud computing revenue.That matters. As much as the world has made good use of the cloud and all the flexibility that comes with it, we've only scratched the surface. IT research outfit Gartner predicts that the total public cloud computing market will exceed $400 billion by 2020, up from last year's $260 billion.SEE ALSO: 53 Best Dividend Stocks for 2018 and BeyondFireEyeMarket value: $3.3 billionWhile most everyone's heard of Microsoft, many people likely haven't heard of FireEye ( FEYE , $16.90). Still, it's one of those Nasdaq stocks worthy of a closer look.FireEye offers a suite of cybersecurity solutions, primarily offered to enterprise-level customers. But it's more than just a collection of firewalls and malware detection tools. FireEye provides services like iSIGHT, which can identify and predict a potential threat to a network before it becomes an actual problem.There is one significant red flag that casts a shadow on the stock: FireEye isn't profitable. It's not even close. A series of acquisitions made over the course of the past several years - before demand for security-as-a-service platforms had gelled - made things fiscally tough for FireEye. A closer inspection of the revenue and income trend, however, suggests a swing to a profit is in sight. Analysts expect the company to turn last year's per-share loss of 16 cents into a 2-cent profit this year, then ramp it up to 17 cents in per-share earnings in 2019.This trend, and this product lineup, prodded Piper Jaffray to upgrade FEYE just a few days before this writing. Analyst Andrew Nowinski wrote, ""Our channel contacts noted that the new pricing bundles are having a positive impact on overall demand trends, which we believe is sustainable and will drive positive operating income and free cash flow starting in (the third quarter of 2018).""SEE ALSO: The 10 Best Tech Stocks of All TimeNuVasiveMarket value: $2.8 billionNuVasive ( NUVA , $54.01) isn't exactly a heavyweight, even within the medical equipment world where it resides. It's also not exactly a fast grower; this year's revenue is only expected to improve by 7%, and that pace will likely slow to less than 6% next year.However, this company has commanding control of its relatively small niche - more than enough control to make it worthy of adding to a watchlist.NuVasive offers spinal surgery solutions. Not only does it create innovate surgical equipment, but it develops the specific procedures to make use of them. Its XLIF procedure is the world's only lateral-approach spinal surgery procedure, made better by improvements like the use of 3D-printed porous titanium implant based on the porous PEEK (polyether ether ketone) technologies it garnered when it acquired Vertera Spine late last year. The modest tweaks and improvement, in sum, keep NuVasive on the cutting edge of the small but reliable spinal surgery market.The past 12 months haven't been stellar. While the Nasdaq has roared ahead by nearly 25%, NUVA shares are off by almost 30% as investors have sought out faster-growing companies. Given Nuvasive's steady, reliable earnings growth though, shares are falling back into favor.SEE ALSO: 10 Underappreciated Biotech Stocks to BuyCelgeneMarket value: $60.5 billionLast but not least, add another biopharma name to a list of Nasdaq stocks that too many people are overlooking: Celgene ( CELG , $83.33).Like Nuvasive, Celgene shares have struggled of late. The stock is down roughly 20% year-to-date, unable to escape from the broad downtrend that has dragged most of the industry lower.But this is a case where investors proverbially threw the baby out with the bathwater. Revenue is on pace to grow nearly 15% this year, and the pros are looking for the top line to swell another 12% next year, largely on the heels of strong growth of Revlimid sales. Revenue driven by the cancer drug grew 19% a quarter ago, and the organization's guidance says it's looking for more of the same kind of growth from its breadwinner going forward.Where Celgene is really starting to shine now that Revlimid is firing on all cylinders, however, is on the earnings growth front. Last year's per-share earnings are projected to reach $8.53 this year, then grow to $10.21 per share next year. With that double-digit earnings growth pace on the table, the forward-looking P/E of 8.2 is arguably a huge bargain.For the record, CELG shares have gained nearly 10% from their June lows, implying investors are starting to realize Celgene shares were unduly punished.SEE ALSO: 10 Blockbuster Drugs of the Future    The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.

"Reuters  @media screen and (max-device-width: 480px){body{ font-size:30pt !important;}}    By Anna Irrera and Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi NEW YORK/ZURICH, July 19 (Reuters) - Swiss regulators are stepping up efforts to halt an exodus of cryptocurrency projects from the country, after two of only a handful of banks active in the nascent sector shut their doors on it in the last year. The departures, which industry sources fear will continue, mean Switzerland is losing business to offshore rivals including Liechtenstein, Gibraltar and the Cayman Islands, where banks are more welcoming.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','',''); The wealthy Swiss canton of Zug, for example, has been dubbed ""Crypto Valley"", with 200-300 virtual currency entities opening there in recent years. Zug's finance director, Heinz Taennler, says they may leave if the government does not take steps to give them access to the banking system, without which they struggle to function. ""All their banking relationships are going to Liechtenstein,"" he told Reuters. ""These are hundreds of jobs that have been created, and every job is important."" Thomas Moser, an alternate member of the governing board at the Swiss National Bank (SNB), said some cryptocurrency companies had asked the central to intervene. ""They raised concerns about problems with opening bank accounts, which was a worry for them, and asked for help,"" Moser told Reuters. ""I said this was not something the SNB dealt with, but they should speak with FINMA. FINMA, Switzerland's financial market supervisor, has held discussions with the SNB and bankers' association on how to make banks more accessible to cryptocurrency ventures. ""We would not want to close the door on the opportunities that such innovation (cryptocurrencies) might bring,"" Moser added. Providing the legal framework to launch ICOs and for banks to do business with cryptocurrency companies is not easy. The risk of fraud and lack of transparency about who owns cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether have made regulators around the world wary. The United States is among countries that are increasing scrutiny of the sector.   BANKS WARY Swiss banks are urging the authorities to give them more clarity on the rules that apply to cryptocurrency projects before providing services to the market, and at least two important players have withdrawn for now. Zuercher Kantonalbank (ZKB), the fourth largest Swiss bank and one of the few big banks in the world to welcome issuers of cryptocurrencies, has closed the accounts of more than 20 companies in the last year, industry sources told Reuters. A spokesman for ZKB declined to comment on any former or existing clients relationships, but said the bank does not do business with any cryptocurrency groups. Another large Swiss bank kicked out crypto project Smart Valor at around the same time, said a person familiar with the project. The source declined to name the bank. Only a handful of Switzerland's 250 banks ever allowed companies to deposit the cash equivalent of cryptocurrencies raised in ICOs. At least two still do, Reuters has established. But the involvement of a large bank like ZKB helped to establish Switzerland as an early cryptocurrency hub. ZKB and the bank that turned its back on Smart Valor began shutting their doors in October after a management feud severely damaged cryptocurrency project Tezos, which had conducted Zug's largest ICO, entrepreneurs and advisers said.  Swiss banks are worried because some companies that carried out ICOs did not do anti-money laundering (AML) checks on their contributors, industry sources said. This means the banks themselves could fall foul of AML rules.   LIECHTENSTEIN A WINNER ""A cautionary response from Swiss banks resulted in a pause or closure for most projects in the cryptocurrency space,""  said David Henderson, founder of the Swiss Sweetbridge Foundation, set up to conduct blockchain startup Sweetbridge's ICO. Sweetbridge was in the late stages of securing an account with ZKB, but the application was put on hold a few days after the Tezos scandal erupted, Henderson said. The project ultimately decided not to carry out its planned ICO through the Swiss foundation, setting up entities and bank accounts in Gibraltar and Liechtenstein instead. It is difficult for crypto-projects to use the funds they raise through ICOs if they are locked out of the banking system. Funds from ICOs are often originally raised in cryptocurrencies bitcoin and ether, which have limited use as a means of payment in the broader economy. ""I cannot pay salaries because our money is caught up there. We cannot move it,"" said the founder of a Swiss crypto-firm which has had accounts closed at three different banks. The banks have asked the firm to take out its money, but it is unable to do so without first finding another banking relationship, the founder added. At least two Swiss banks are still accepting ICO funds, according to checks by Reuters. These are Banca Zarattini, a small bank in the Italian-language canton Ticino, and Hypothekarbank Lenzburg, a regional lender located between Zurich and Basel, which recently began accepting crypto customers. Banca Zarattini only banks ICO companies with KYC (know-your-customer) and AML procedures that are in compliance with Swiss law, it said. Hypothekarbank Lenzburg said it had started to accept crytocurrency companies and could charge an initial assessment fee of up to 2,500 Swiss francs($2,500). Bank Frick in Liechtenstein has become a popular alternative for Swiss entities struggling to secure accounts. It banks around 160 crypto-enterprises or projects, of which 60 are in the process of setting up an ICO, the bank told Reuters. The bank, however, declined 90 percent of account requests from cryptocurrency companies and only accepts ICOs based onshore in Switzerland or Liechtenstein, it said.   RULES AND REASSURANCES Despite the challenges, Switzerland is working on new rules to reassure banks and encourage them to accept the accounts of cryptocurrency companies. The country has dropped from second place in 2017 to sixth this year in a country ranking of the sum of ICO funds raised,  according to a study published by PwC and the Crypto Valley Association in June. The Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands topped the list. In May, Swiss Finance Minister Ueli Maurer invited FINMA, the central bank and the Swiss Bankers Association (SBA) to a roundtable discussion on bank accounts for cryptocurrencies. After the meeting, the SBA set up a working group to compile a set of checks and conditions that all banks could follow when opening an account for cryptocurrency firms. ""Banks are currently hesitant to open business accounts for companies with particular touchpoints to ICOs and cryptocurrencies - due to risks such as fraud or money laundering,"" SBA said in a statement. Zug finance director Taennler said the aim set out during the meeting, which he attended, was to have a set of FINMA-approved guidelines for assessing prospective cryptocurrency clients by the year-end. FINMA has already issued separate guidelines to spell out how Swiss AML rules and securities regulations apply to various ICOs. But securities rules are less stringent in Switzerland than in the United States, where the Securities and Exchange Commission has toughened its stance on ICOs.  This makes it more risky for banks in Switzerland to be involved with ICO projects which may have raised money from U.S. contributors and could fall under the purview of the SEC. Switzerland's authorities have said they want to create conditions for the country to remain competitive but with no room for scams or financial crime. The finance ministry is also looking at the broader legal framework for blockchain technology and ICOs. Its findings will be presented to the federal government by the end of the year and will determine how the technology fits into existing Swiss laws and regulations.

Zuercher Kantonalbank (ZKB), the fourth largest Swiss bank and one of the few big banks in the world to welcome issuers of cryptocurrencies, has closed the accounts of more than 20 companies in the last year, industry sources told Reuters. A spokesman for ZKB declined to comment on any former or existing clients relationships, but said the bank does not do business with any cryptocurrency groups. Another large Swiss bank kicked out crypto project Smart Valor at around the same time, said a person familiar with the project. The source declined to name the bank. Only a handful of Switzerland's 250 banks ever allowed companies to deposit the cash equivalent of cryptocurrencies raised in ICOs. At least two still do, Reuters has established. But the involvement of a large bank like ZKB helped to establish Switzerland as an early cryptocurrency hub. ZKB and the bank that turned its back on Smart Valor began shutting their doors in October after a management feud severely damaged cryptocurrency project Tezos, which had conducted Zug's largest ICO, entrepreneurs and advisers said.  Swiss banks are worried because some companies that carried out ICOs did not do anti-money laundering (AML) checks on their contributors, industry sources said. This means the banks themselves could fall foul of AML rules.   LIECHTENSTEIN A WINNER ""A cautionary response from Swiss banks resulted in a pause or closure for most projects in the cryptocurrency space,""  said David Henderson, founder of the Swiss Sweetbridge Foundation, set up to conduct blockchain startup Sweetbridge's ICO. Sweetbridge was in the late stages of securing an account with ZKB, but the application was put on hold a few days after the Tezos scandal erupted, Henderson said. The project ultimately decided not to carry out its planned ICO through the Swiss foundation, setting up entities and bank accounts in Gibraltar and Liechtenstein instead. It is difficult for crypto-projects to use the funds they raise through ICOs if they are locked out of the banking system. Funds from ICOs are often originally raised in cryptocurrencies bitcoin and ether, which have limited use as a means of payment in the broader economy. ""I cannot pay salaries because our money is caught up there. We cannot move it,"" said the founder of a Swiss crypto-firm which has had accounts closed at three different banks. The banks have asked the firm to take out its money, but it is unable to do so without first finding another banking relationship, the founder added. At least two Swiss banks are still accepting ICO funds, according to checks by Reuters. These are Banca Zarattini, a small bank in the Italian-language canton Ticino, and Hypothekarbank Lenzburg, a regional lender located between Zurich and Basel, which recently began accepting crypto customers. Banca Zarattini only banks ICO companies with KYC (know-your-customer) and AML procedures that are in compliance with Swiss law, it said. Hypothekarbank Lenzburg said it had started to accept crytocurrency companies and could charge an initial assessment fee of up to 2,500 Swiss francs($2,500). Bank Frick in Liechtenstein has become a popular alternative for Swiss entities struggling to secure accounts. It banks around 160 crypto-enterprises or projects, of which 60 are in the process of setting up an ICO, the bank told Reuters. The bank, however, declined 90 percent of account requests from cryptocurrency companies and only accepts ICOs based onshore in Switzerland or Liechtenstein, it said.   RULES AND REASSURANCES Despite the challenges, Switzerland is working on new rules to reassure banks and encourage them to accept the accounts of cryptocurrency companies. The country has dropped from second place in 2017 to sixth this year in a country ranking of the sum of ICO funds raised,  according to a study published by PwC and the Crypto Valley Association in June. The Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands topped the list. In May, Swiss Finance Minister Ueli Maurer invited FINMA, the central bank and the Swiss Bankers Association (SBA) to a roundtable discussion on bank accounts for cryptocurrencies. After the meeting, the SBA set up a working group to compile a set of checks and conditions that all banks could follow when opening an account for cryptocurrency firms. ""Banks are currently hesitant to open business accounts for companies with particular touchpoints to ICOs and cryptocurrencies - due to risks such as fraud or money laundering,"" SBA said in a statement. Zug finance director Taennler said the aim set out during the meeting, which he attended, was to have a set of FINMA-approved guidelines for assessing prospective cryptocurrency clients by the year-end. FINMA has already issued separate guidelines to spell out how Swiss AML rules and securities regulations apply to various ICOs. But securities rules are less stringent in Switzerland than in the United States, where the Securities and Exchange Commission has toughened its stance on ICOs.  This makes it more risky for banks in Switzerland to be involved with ICO projects which may have raised money from U.S. contributors and could fall under the purview of the SEC. Switzerland's authorities have said they want to create conditions for the country to remain competitive but with no room for scams or financial crime. The finance ministry is also looking at the broader legal framework for blockchain technology and ICOs. Its findings will be presented to the federal government by the end of the year and will determine how the technology fits into existing Swiss laws and regulations.

"    When you were a young'un, your parents may have sat you down   to talk about the ""birds and the bees."" Now it's time to turn the   tables and address another uncomfortable topic: their   finances. Such conversations mark a reversal in the traditional   parent-child dynamic, and also can be fraught with concerns over   independence, trust and mortality. As a result, these talks often   don't happen at all, and a perceived lack of urgency is to blame,   according to a 2018 survey conducted by Wells Fargo. Roughly one-third of parents over the age of 60 say they've   never discussed later-life needs with family, including   inheritance plans, beneficiaries, important documents or   designated representatives, according to the survey. Meanwhile,   adult children worry such conversations will cause conflict or   make it seem as though they're after their parents' money.makeArticleAd(); As daunting as it may seem, it's important to have ""the talk""   about finances with your parents to help protect them from scams   and elder abuse, which cost Americans more than $36 billion each   year, according to financial services firm True Link Financial.   These conversations also ensure that a rapid-response plan is in   place in the event of disability and that there are no surprises   after your parents die, says Ron Long, head of regulatory affairs   and elder client initiatives at Wells Fargo Advisors. These four tips can open lines of communication. 1. Start with one conversation When's a good time to sit your parents down for a hard   conversation about their financial well-being, plans for the   future and important legal and financial documents like a will,   power of attorney or health care directives? The twelfth of   never, for most children. Don't wait for tragedy to strike.

""It's a good   way to get the conversation started and then you can do a   refresher or update down the road."" The first conversation should serve as a door-opener. There   are weighty decisions at play - which may change over time with   your parents' mental or physical health - so don't expect a   one-and-done conversation. 2. Begin with the basics Talking about money inspires reactions ranging from secretive   to forthright. Even if your parents aren't particularly prickly   about discussing their finances, it's prudent to ease into such   conversations. Long says a strategy that's ""very helpful"" is approaching   discussions from a group-planning perspective - sharing what   end-of-life goals you're considering and asking your parents   about theirs. ""Remember, these are subjects that a lot of older   folks hold close to their hearts,"" he says. Be sensitive when starting that initial conversation. Think   less interrogative (how much money's at stake and who gets what?)   and more collaborative (exchanging information about where   accounts are held or who has power of attorney). 3. Broach serious topics Once you've established a rapport, tackle topics that make   either you or your parents uncomfortable, including the morose   (funeral arrangements or declining health) and the dangerous   (financial scams targeting seniors that could wipe out their   savings). Don't let the prospect of an awkward conversation now create a   bigger headache in the future. Strive for this balance:   confronting reality head-on without infantilizing or offending   your parents. A bad way to deal? Shutting down future   conversations when talks are strained.

"      If you're a fan of binge-watching your favorite shows on Netflix NFLX  or like to listen to your music without any interruptions on Spotify SPOT  , then you may not like the sound of this. On Wednesday, US Senators Brian Schatz and John Thune introduced a bill that calls for governments to explore the idea of alerting viewers of any potential disasters through streaming media services. The proposed legislation is called Reliable Emergency Alert Distribution Improvement, or the READI act. It has been designed to alert viewers of any potential threats that might be coming their way through smartphones, TVs and radios. As of now, it isn't even certain if the bill will pass and actually become law. However, if it does, viewers can expect to see alerts while watching their favorite shows.  Will This Affect the Amount of Media Consumers?  According to Forbes  , Spotify hit 50 million subscribers in 2017. The number has only gone up since then, with more and more people paying for the premium subscription, which includes listening to your music without any ads or interruptions. Similarly, in Netflix's most recent quarter, the company reported 130 million subscribers for their media streaming service. Spotify and Netflix have both become very popular over the years, especially amongst a younger crowd. Along with millennials becoming accustomed to using these media streaming services as their primary source of entertainment, younger generations also use them. Seeing as there is a Netflix Kids section, it could be of concern if emergency alerts were to pop up, as a younger crowd might get frightened or not understand what's going on. If this bill gets passed, it could be concerning for these media companies, as consumers might not want any disruptions while watching a show or listening to music. Perhaps this could lead to fewer subscribers for Netflix and Spotify, or maybe not. Even though there might be a disruption here or there, these emergency alerts essentially save lives if handled correctly.  Could there be Potential Mishaps?  Alerting people when nothing wrong is going to happen has occurred in the past, and recently happened in Hawaii, when a state employee misheard a recorded message which was part of an unscheduled drill and broadcasted a false alarm about a nuclear attack. As mentioned before, an emergency alert is there to help people, but management needs to be the one to carry it out correctly and effectively. However, according to  cnet,  the READI act will implement lessons learned from past mishaps and incidents, as well as recognize that emergency protocols must also change as communication technology changes.    Bottom Line  There's no doubt that if this were to become a law, it would ensure the safety for many, but we can't be certain whether or not consumers of these media services will like it or not.

"Shares of   Netflix    (NASDAQ: NFLX) recently pulled back after the company said its   member growth was   lower than expected    . But this shouldn't trick investors into thinking Netflix is   having a problem growing its member base. Indeed, the company is   adding more members on a trailing-12-month basis than ever before   -- and it's doing this while rolling out price increases. Thanks to the 26 million streaming members Netflix has added   over the past 12 months, Netflix's global member count has   swelled to an impressive 130 million members. Of these members,   124 million are paid memberships -- up from 99 million at this   time last year. Strong growth rates in Netflix's members   recently suggest there's plenty of upside left for this key   metric.   Image source: Netflix.makeArticleAd(); Here's a breakdown of Netflix's members as of the end of the   company's most recent quarter, as well as what to expect from   member growth in the coming years. U.S. members The U.S. is undoubtedly Netflix's most important market.   Though international streaming members surpassed U.S. streaming   members for the first time last year, the U.S. market's   contribution profit more than doubles the contribution profit   from all of Netflix's international market's combined. In   Netflix's   second quarter of 2018    , for instance, the company's U.S. contribution profit was $740   million. In the same period, Netflix's international contribution   profit was $298 million. And a similar trend is expected to   persist in Q3, with management guiding for U.S. and international   contribution profits for the period of $730 million and $290   million, respectively. With Netflix's U.S. market accounting for such a significant   portion of the company's contribution profit, it makes sense that   investors are always watching to see whether the market is   showing signs of saturation. Fortunately, Netflix's U.S. members   are still growing nicely. Sure, second-quarter U.S. member   additions of 670,000 were down from 1.07 million additions in the   year-ago quarter, but Netflix's 2.63 million new U.S. members in   the first six months of 2018 were actually higher than the 2.07   million members the company added in the first six months of   2017. Overall, Netflix boasts about 58 million streaming members in   the U.S., of which 56 million are paid memberships.  International members  The U.S. may be Netflix's biggest contributor to the company's   bottom line, but it's Netflix's international segment that's   driving the bulk of the streaming-TV company's growth. Not only   did Netflix's international streaming members climb an incredible   40% year over year in Q2, but its international segment swung   from a contribution loss of $13 million in the year-ago quarter   to a contribution profit of $298 million in the second quarter of   2018. And Netflix expects more strong growth in the key metric in   Q3, with management guiding for an international contribution   profit of $290 million -- up from $62 million in the third   quarter of 2017. In total, Netflix has about 72 million streaming members   internationally. About 68 million of those members are paying   users.  Looking ahead  Despite increasing competition in the streaming TV space   recently, Netflix continues to grow its members at strong rates.   And Netflix's recent strong growth suggests more of the same is   on the horizon throughout 2018 and beyond. Sure, Netflix's member growth will undoubtedly slow over time.   But there's still plenty of runway left. In the company's next   quarter alone, management expects to add another 5 million   members -- in line with its member additions in the third quarter   of 2017. In addition, Netflix said in its long-term update on its   business earlier this year that it believes members in the U.S.   could rise as high as 90 million over the long haul. And   while it's more difficult to forecast the upside for Netflix's   international market, the 21 million members Netflix added   internationally over the last 12 months suggest there's huge room   for growth abroad.   10 stocks we like better than Netflix       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Unfortunately, as is often the case, the opposite happens.In the most recent example of corporate B.S., AT&T upped the monthly fee for its cheapest DirectTV Now plan by 14% from $35 to $40 just days after Leon gave the thumbs up.Sure, AT&T rolled out the usual consumer benefits arguments that companies make when looking for M&A approvals, but should the Democrats win back control of Congress after the mid-term elections in November, you can be sure they'll revisit the AT&T merger at some point in 2019 to see if it has lived up to its promises.Sadly, they'll find it hasn't.Problems for the Time Warner-AT&T Merger: HBO Gets RuinedThis one is a big one given that HBO generated 29% of Time Warner's overall operating income in 2017.HBO doesn't have the most content available but what it does deliver to customers generally wins critical acclaim. Although Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) got more Emmy nominations this year ending HBO's 17-year reign as the leading nomination-getter, it still managed to pull in 108 nominations, just three shy of last year.Unfortunately, that's about to change now that AT&T's in charge.""We need hours a day,"" AT&T Media CEO John Stankey said recently of the time subscribers spend watching HBO content. ""It's not hours a week, and it's not hours a month. We need hours a day. You are competing with devices that sit in people's hands that capture their attention every 15 minutes.""AT&T wants HBO to compete head-on with Netflix by growing the amount of content available and by extension the number of subscribers - it's currently 40 million in the U.S. and 142 million worldwide - and that's going to completely change the network's reason for being and formula for success.10 Cheap Consumer Stocks for an Uncertain MarketLong-term, many experts believe that's a mistake. It will be easy to see why when the quality of its content drops considerably.Problems for the Time Warner-AT&T Merger: Huge Amount of DebtThis point is the one that bothers me the most because it represents the single biggest problem with corporate America today.Big companies are up to their armpits in cheap debt; debt that's going to get a lot more expensive over the next few years."" AT&T is going to have $175 billion in debt. It currently  pays an average of 3.75%  on its debt,"" I wrote last October. ""Let's assume the interest rate it pays stays around that level - it will cost the company $6.6 billion in the first year. A 1% increase in the rate paid equals a $1.7 billion increase in the payments to $8.3 billion annually. A 2% increase to 5.75% would mean a 53% bump to $10.1 billion.""There are plenty of AT&T supporters out there who argue that Time Warner gives it plenty of cash flow - approximately $4 billion in free cash flow annually - to pay down its debt.And while that's true, it's also possible that the assets it buys, such as HBO, deteriorate over time, much like AT&T's previous acquisition of DirecTV, which has seen the company lose approximately one million cable TV and satellite subscribers since the $48 billion acquisition.I believe its massive bet at this point in the credit cycle is unbelievably burdensome on a balance sheet that was already overly indebted.And god help AT&T should a recession happen.Problems for the Time Warner-AT&T Merger: Clash of the Corporate CulturesAT&T's CEO doesn't believe there will be a culture clash between employees at the two companies - but how can there not be?AT&T is a telecom company full of techies while Time Warner is a content company full of creative types. Merging those two is like blending oil and water; it's just not that simple.""It's important that we preserve the culture,"" AT&T's CEO told CNBC recently. ""John Stankey has spent a lot of time the first couple of weeks making sure that he's touching the employees, touching the talent. Making sure that they understand that they will be left to do what they do best.""7 Top S&P 500 Stocks to Consider for Long-Term GainsThe problem with words is they also require action to be truly impactful. So far, AT&T has shown its true stripes early in its ownership of Time Warner by raising fees and proposing a significant change in HBO's DNA. This could see many its most creative employees jump ship.I just don't see the two work cultures not clashing. Problems for the Time Warner-AT&T Merger: Innovation DisappearsThe chief competition economist for the European Commission, Tommaso Valletti, studied the effect of mergers on research and development and innovation at large companies.Valletti found that in specific industries and markets, mergers reduce overall innovation with customers ultimately paying the price.Interestingly, Time ran a story in 2014 entitled ""Mega-Mergers Are Killing Innovation"" that came on the heels of AT&T's acquisition plans for DirecTV.""Consolidation can be good for consumers as bigger companies have the resources to innovate and provide new products and services which might otherwise never materialize,"" wroteTime contributor Sanjay Sanghoee. ""However, the vertical integration of the telecommunications and technology sectors can also restrict innovation due to decreased competition and the limitation of research to specific technologies that support existing business lines.""I don't think there's any doubt the merger of these two companies will result in less money and time being spent on innovation.Problems for the Time Warner-AT&T Merger: Synergies and Cost Savings Fall ShortThe buzzwords of big mergers are synergies and cost savings. Executives throw these sorts of numbers out there as a carrot for investors and rarely do they materialize to the extent advertised.In the case of AT&T and Time Warner, the merged entity expects to reduce costs by $1.5 billion annually by 2021 while also generating $1 billion annually in increased revenues from synergies between the two companies.If it were to use the entire $2.5 billion to pay down debt, it could shave about 14% off its overall indebtedness over the next decade without accounting for any of the $4 billion in annual free cash flow Time Warner already generates.So, let's say that in addition to the $2.5 billion in synergies, the company uses the entire $4 billion also to pay down debt; AT&T could cut 36% of its debt over the next ten years.But that's a big if, because generally companies overestimate the synergies and savings to be gained from mergers.""The average acquirer materially overestimates the synergies a merger will yield. These synergies can come from economies of scale and scope, best practice, the sharing of capabilities and opportunities, and, often, the stimulating effect of the combination on the individual companies,"" stated a McKinsey & Company article from 2004. ""However, it takes only a very small degree of error in estimating these values to cause an acquisition effort to stumble.""7 Alternative Internet of Things Stocks to BuyIt might be a 14-year-old quote, but in my experience, nothing has changed when it comes to large mergers like the one pulled off by AT&T.In five years, I'm sure investors will have forgotten the promises Randall Stephenson made regarding synergies and cost savings.Problems for the Time Warner-AT&T Merger: Big Deals Generally FailWhile the odds of a merger succeeding are much higher than winning a lottery - KPMG estimates that about  one-third of mergers in North America add value - AT&T shareholders ought to lower their expectations for success.KPMG also found that nearly 70% of mergers in North America either deliver zero value to shareholders or reduce it.Four reasons why mergers fail, according to five-time CEO Margaret Heffernan include momentum, not enough due diligence, debt and power struggles.Momentum means that once AT&T launched the regulatory process to get the merger approved, there was no way it was going to put the brakes on the deal.Every acquirer likes to think it's done it has due diligence, but that rarely turns out to be the case despite their multi-billion-dollar price tags.The third reason, debt, I've already spoken about.Finally, somewhat akin to the corporate culture discussion, rarely are mergers equal partnerships. There are going to be bruised egos at Time Warner - think HBO - creating friction between the two entities.Stephenson says Time Warner will be run entirely independent of AT&T; history suggests his words won't accurately reflect what's happening.As of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.Compare BrokersThe post 7 Reasons AT&T Is Going to Blow the Time Warner Merger appeared first on InvestorPlace .

"In this segment from    MarketFoolery     , host Mac Greer and Motley Fool senior analysts Andy Cross and   Jason Moser tune in for the surprise twist of the week: a   Netflix    (NASDAQ: NFLX) quarterly report in which it did not meet or beat   expectations on subscriber growth. But does this really signal a   change in the long-term story arc for the streaming media giant,   or was it just a hiccup? The analysts are more interested in other aspects of the   Netflix tale, and they explain the metrics they're watching, as   well as their views on the company's strategies, content, and   rivals. A full transcript follows the video.makeArticleAd();   10 stocks we like better than Netflix       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,     Motley Fool Stock Advisor      , has quadrupled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the      10 best stocks       for investors to buy right now... and Netflix wasn't one of     them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even     better buys.   Click here       to learn about these picks!  *Stock Advisor returns as of June 4, 2018         This video was recorded on July 17, 2018.   Mac Greer:    Guys, let's kick things off with Netflix earnings. We have some   concerns over slowing subscriber growth. Jason, shares down   around 8% at the time of our taping. That wasn't nearly as bad as   they had been at the open of the market. Now, I have to ask you,   Netflix the stock has been on an incredible roll. Their earnings   were actually better than expected. Is this a case of unrealistic   or unsustainable expectations? Or is there a storm on the   horizon?  Jason Moser:    That's a very good question.  Greer:    Thank you!  Moser:    I would just say maybe. [laughs] Maybe to all of it! I think,   probably, the reaction mostly is attributable to the fact that   it's not all that often that management misses their own   subscriber targets. They're really good about hitting the targets   that they set, and often exceeding them. So, when they miss their   targets, I think the market takes a little bit of a step back and   hits reset. The stock has obviously had a great year. The stock in   comparison to the business and its obligations is a little out of   whack. So, a little bit of a pullback probably makes some sense   here. But, as an investor, for me, the question is less about the   number of subscribers -- that's important, but I think Netflix is   big enough now where that question is becoming a little less   relevant. To me, the more relevant question is the pricing power   that they're going to be able to exercise with their subscriber   base over time. Netflix is not going anywhere. They have a pretty good product   for the price that you're paying. I think it's top of mind for   anyone who's looking to get their first streaming service. For   me, I wonder how high they're going to actually be able to take   the price of that subscription before people start to get a   little turned off of it. I know, personally, I'm close. I don't   feel like their content is all that good, to be honest. I don't   know if you saw Josh Brown earlier today, he was talking about   the fact that they have so much content and not a lot of it is   very good. That may be a bit of a controversial opinion. I don't   know. For me personally, I'm not impressed with all that much of   their content, and I find that the platform is becoming more and   more difficult to navigate because they have so much of it.  Andy Cross:    That's a good point, Jason. I disagree with Josh a little   bit.  Greer:    Who's Josh Brown?  Cross:    He works at Ritholtz Capital. He's wonderful, he's prolific on   Twitter    and he writes a lot, a very smart thinker. To his point, there   are 130 million numbers now on Netflix globally. Worldwide, on   average, we watch two hours a day. We consume a fifth of the   bandwidth on Netflix. A fifth of the total bandwidth that's used   goes to Netflix. So, clearly there are a lot of people who continue to use the   service in vast ways around the world as they continue to expand   more and more globally. Now they have more international   subscribers than they do in the U.S. Their net additions -- which   was the concern with the stock price today, Mac -- came in a   little bit lighter. As Jason said, they missed their own   expectations. First of all, they're very transparent about those   expectations. It's fantastic from an analyst's perspective.   They're open and honest when they hit that. Now, they didn't give   much of a reason on why that was. They didn't really blame the   price increase they put in over the last few months. Their   average price was up about 14% year over year. When you just think about the pricing power, to Jason's point,   how much you will pay and what you have to pay for that,   vis-a-vis what Netflix has to pay for that content, Jason,   they're going to spend somewhere between $10-12 billion this year   on content acquisition, both their own plus licensing deals.   Goldman Sachs    estimates that by 2022, they could be spending more than $20   billion on content acquisition and developing content. Netflix is really developing into this   studio-plus-distribution model. As an investor in Netflix, people   are wondering, is that the model that's going to be the future?   Will they have pricing power for that? Will they be able to   generate not just the profits but also the cash flow to be able   to sustain that? They borrowed almost $2 billion recently in the   last quarter of this year to be able to fund that. Mac, you're talking about a business that has been humming   along The stock price has been fantastic this year, and one of   the drivers of the market in general. Certainly, when the   subscriber additions come in light like this, investors start to   wonder, are we starting to see a little bit of the challenge that   Netflix will have for the future when it comes to their growth   prospects?  Greer:    For me, it's all about Stranger Things. If Netflix didn't have   Stranger Things, I don't know if I'd subscribe. But, you know   what? That's incredibly powerful. It reminds me of HBO back in   the day. At the end of the day, I don't think people have a   relationship with Netflix, per say. They have a relationship with   certain shows that they love. As long as you have a Stranger   Things, or your equivalent of a Stranger Things, then all the   other stuff on Netflix can be overwhelming, it can be junk, it   can be stuff that I never watch, and I don't care, because I'm   getting value from that one show. Now, the problem is, you have   to keep cranking out that one show.  Moser:    You have to keep cranking it out. To Andy's point, they are   closing in on $20 billion in content obligations already. I'm   glad that you brought up the HBO point, because that's what I was   thinking about this morning. It's these two different strategies,   Netflix vs. HBO. We remember how Reed Hastings said they were   trying to become HBO faster than HBO could become them. But   really, they are two different strategies to this point. I think that Netflix has benefited from this strategy of   producing a lot of stuff. You're right, most of it, I don't   really care about. But they're producing a little bit of   something for a lot of people out there. They have this   tremendous cross-section of content. Maybe you don't like most of   the stuff that's on there, but there are a couple of shows that   you really do like. They're really trying to do that to be able   to grow this huge audience, to cast the widest net possible. HBO traditionally has been a more concentrated content   portfolio. That's why they've not been able to grow that   subscriber base in quite the same way, not to mention the fact   that they were late to the over the top game, as well. But, it   does seem like they're two very different strategies in the way   that they're spending to develop that content. I think that's what ultimately brought that question in   pricing power up to me. If it's not the place where I'm getting   most of the stuff that I like, how willing am I going to be to   pay $X for it? I don't know. That's going to be different for   everybody. But, I think we're getting closer to really having to   examine that question as far as the investment.  Cross:    Here's one of the keys that I see for Netflix. We've talked about   this over the years. You guys may disagree with this. As   consumption of media becomes more and more fragmented -- and it   is. We have longer tails, we have more and more titles that we   can watch. Jason is absolutely right, there are more and more   titles that fewer and fewer people are watching. Most of the   hours consumed, whether it's on Netflix or YouTube or at a movie   theater, continue to be concentrated in fewer titles. So, the   overall volume is more, but the number of titles is more   fragmented than it was before. Here's the key with Netflix, it's in their technology and   their recommendation engine. They've been developing this over   the years. I think they have a years-ahead advantage of other   competitors in this space. It allows them to be able to buy or   develop those titles, and develop the algorithm that tells them,   ""Mac likes this, Andy likes this, Jason likes this."" The titles   can be fragmented. It's much different than when you go into a grocery store.   This is what I'm starting to see with Whole Foods, guys, by the   way. You go into Whole Foods, and now, all the aisles are jammed   with stuff that they're trying to sell you. Netflix has the   algorithm and the technology behind it to help me find the stuff   that I want to find -- not just me, but also help my two   daughters and my wife, be able to find what might be right for   them. It allows them to justify, potentially, the massive amount   of dollars they're going to spend on titles.  Moser:    That's funny. I find that that recommendation engine is lacking.   I find that whether it's Netflix or   Amazon    (NASDAQ: AMZN) or Hulu or whatever, I will more watch a show   based on word of mouth from friends as opposed to what Netflix is   recommending me. It's not just Netflix. I go to Amazon and the   same thing will happen. But, you could sit there and surf around   for 30 minutes and find nothing that's all that compelling, and   then you just wasted a bunch of time. I think, to me, that's where it's lacking. Part of that is   probably because there's so much content out there now. It is   more difficult to find what you want to watch, so you rely more   and more on that word of mouth from your friends. There are some   shows that I've caught thanks to word of mouth vs. relying on a   recommendation engine. That's where I wonder if, maybe, they're not getting flooded   with too much stuff that makes it a bit more difficult to isolate   and identify the stuff that you're going to enjoy or that Mac is   going to enjoy. That's their goal, right? Personalize it as well   as they can. It just seems like they may have a bit too much   stuff out there to make it as effective as possible.  Cross:    It's high-class problems for developed countries. The big story   for Netflix is international growth, as it continues to put more   and more effort and dollars into growing internationally and   entering all the new markets, especially India. They're spending   a lot of effort joining in India, where they're very new to the   market. Of course, they're not even in China, really. When you think about going into markets where the markets are   still forming and the profitability on the international side is   so much less than what it is on the U.S. side for Netflix, the   ability to drive hopefully both growth and profits   internationally is a real opportunity for Netflix. You want to continue to see both the sub growth, as well as   the profitability in international. But, I think the technology   and the offerings that they're bringing specifically for   international markets really does give them an advantage that no   other player has globally. Now, there are very niche offerings in   those markets, but globally, no one else does that like Netflix   does.  Moser:    It's going to be fascinating, the Indian market. I think India   was mentioned 21 times in Netflix's call. We know that Amazon   Prime is already making big inroads into India. I think both   companies right there see India as a great opportunity. It's a   little bit more price-sensitive, so I think they're trying to   figure out the offerings there, and how they can cater to   customers' price expectations. But no question, a tremendous   opportunity.  Greer:    Guys, as we wrap this up, I want to talk a little about the   external competition. Jason, you just mentioned Amazon, we   mentioned HBO earlier. HBO, by the way, recently announced a   strategy shift. They suggested they're going to be focusing, I   found the quote, on getting ""bigger and broader."" That'll be   interesting to watch. If you're Reed Hastings and you're looking at your external   competitors, who are you worried most about? Let's reel off a few   -- HBO, Amazon and their streaming service, or   Disney    (NYSE: DIS) ? We haven't even talked about Disney's streaming   service, which comes out next year.  Moser:    I think, bigger and broader, like you said, for HBO, that's   interesting, because that's becoming a bit more like Netflix,   isn't it? For me, I think Amazon is really gaining a lot of steam   in this space. But, the thing that really interests me is how Disney is going   to deal with Hulu going forward. I ask that because Hulu has a   very compelling skinny bundle package now. It's around $40-45   that you can pay for commercial- free streaming along with live   TV. So, you get your sports, your news, your live TV offerings   from channels, if you're going to be watching some linear TV   series. I think that Disney has big plans with Hulu in some capacity   with their offerings, plus ESPN. Hulu has a lot of potential. I   think that's one where you have to start looking at it and   thinking, ""Hmm, maybe that's going to be a player that comes up   pretty quickly in this space and starts to compete a little bit   more.""  Cross:    My worry with Hulu is all ownership structures they have and all   the voices they have contributing to that story. With something   like Netflix, even Disney, to a certain extent, but with Netflix,   you have Reed Hastings and his team continuing to focus. I know,   Mac, you mentioned the competitive landscape. Certainly, I   imagine they pay attention to what's happening in that space. But   as I said, in the conference call, and I've talked about it in   the past, the focus on driving their business and the focus on   their engine and their competitive opportunity and what they have   in their assets. So, when I look across the competitive   landscape, I just think Netflix has advantages and has that   first-movers advantages that other global players can't quite   match.

"    Shares of Disney DIS  surged over 3% in morning trading Thursday after Comcast CMCSA  announced that it will no longer pursue key 21st Century Fox FOXA  entertainment assets. Disney now looks poised to secure Fox's film and TV studio, as well as other properties, in a move that could propel the conglomerate in the age of Netflix NFLX  .  The Deal  Comcast said Thursday that it won't outbid Disney's $71.3 billion cash and stock offer for Fox's film and TV studios, cable networks such as FX, a controlling stake in Hulu, and international properties including Star India. Notably left out of any potential deal are Fox News, Fox Sports 1, and the Fox broadcast network. Another asset up for grabs is European pay-TV giant Sky PLC, which Fox currently owns 39% of. Comcast now hopes to secure Sky for itself in order to expand beyond its mostly domestic web. Last week, the cable and internet giant outbid Fox in its pursuit of complete control in Sky. Now the question is will Disney push Fox to raise its offer. ""Twenty-First Century Fox may elect not to increase the price offered by it in the Sky acquisition and any increase in the debt financing for the Sky acquisition would require Disney's consent, which Disney may elect not to provide,"" Disney said an SEC filing last Friday. Comcast's decision also follows the U.S. Justice Department's recent announcement that it will appeal a federal judge's decision to approve the AT&T T  and Time Warner merger. With that said, Disney's bid to buy some of Rupert Murdoch's media empire was approved by the Justice Department at the end of June, after Disney agreed to divest Fox's regional sports networks.  Why Disney Wants the Deal  The Justice Department's conditions still allow Disney to absorb the parts of Fox that are vital to its long-term streaming strategy, including Hulu-which had previously been in question. Disney plans to roll out a stand-alone streaming service in late 2019 that aims to compete directly against Netflix, Amazon AMZN  , and soon enough Apple AAPL  , as the cord-cutting revolution rages on. The company will be able to utilize Fox's TV and movie franchises such as The Simpsons  , Avatar  , X-Men  , and many more at the box office, on streaming services, and in its expanding theme park business. Investors should think of this new entertainment arms race based mostly on the accumulation of content and franchises people are willing to pay to watch. Disney's streaming platform will theoretically see it bundle all of its historic and cartoon content and its new live-action remakes, along with its Pixar, Marvel, and LucasFilm offerings. Disney already has plans to make new a live-action Star Wars series as well as new Marvel shows. Disney could also easily adapt to Netflix's model of offering a wide range of small-budget ""indie"" films and shows along with its blockbusters and family-friendly Disney and Pixar movies, which are also released in theaters-something that still hasn't lost its appeal altogether.  Recent Performance  Shares of Disney have surged roughly 270% over the last 10 years, doubling the S&P 500's climb. However, DIS stock has moved mostly sideways over the last three years and has experienced some pretty heavy turbulence over the last 12 months.       Valuation  Moving on, Disney's valuation picture looks solid these days. DIS is currently trading at 15.1X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which marks a discount compared to its industry 22.4X average and the S&P's 17.4X. Over the last year, DIS has traded as high as 17.8X and as low as 13.4X, with a one-year median of 15.3X. Investors can also see that  Disney stock  is currently trading near its five-year low. Therefore, it isn't too much of a stretch to say that DIS looks rather attractive at its current level.     Growth Outlook  Looking ahead, the entertainment power's quarterly earnings are expected to surge by over 29% to reach $2.04 per share, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. Meanwhile, Disney's full-year earnings are projected touch $7.09 per share, which would represent over a 24% expansion. Disney is also expected to see its quarterly revenues climb by 10.1% to hit $15.68 billion, while its full-year revenues are projected to pop by 7.7% to reach $59.36 billion.  Bottom Line  Disney has seen its full-year earnings estimate climb from $6.93 per share to $7.09 share over the last 90 days. The company is also currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) that boasts an ""A"" grade for Value and a ""B"" for growth in our Style Scores system.

"Reuters  @media screen and (max-device-width: 480px){body{ font-size:30pt !important;}}    By Anna Irrera and Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi NEW YORK/ZURICH, July 19 (Reuters) - Swiss regulators are stepping up efforts to halt an exodus of cryptocurrency projects from the country, after two of only a handful of banks active in the nascent sector shut their doors on it in the last year. The departures, which industry sources fear will continue, mean Switzerland is losing business to offshore rivals including Liechtenstein, Gibraltar and the Cayman Islands, where banks are more welcoming.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','',''); The wealthy Swiss canton of Zug, for example, has been dubbed ""Crypto Valley"", with 200-300 virtual currency entities opening there in recent years. Zug's finance director, Heinz Taennler, says they may leave if the government does not take steps to give them access to the banking system, without which they struggle to function. ""All their banking relationships are going to Liechtenstein,"" he told Reuters. ""These are hundreds of jobs that have been created, and every job is important."" Thomas Moser, an alternate member of the governing board at the Swiss National Bank (SNB), said some cryptocurrency companies had asked the central to intervene. ""They raised concerns about problems with opening bank accounts, which was a worry for them, and asked for help,"" Moser told Reuters. ""I said this was not something the SNB dealt with, but they should speak with FINMA. FINMA, Switzerland's financial market supervisor, has held discussions with the SNB and bankers' association on how to make banks more accessible to cryptocurrency ventures. ""We would not want to close the door on the opportunities that such innovation (cryptocurrencies) might bring,"" Moser added. Providing the legal framework to launch ICOs and for banks to do business with cryptocurrency companies is not easy. The risk of fraud and lack of transparency about who owns cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether have made regulators around the world wary. The United States is among countries that are increasing scrutiny of the sector.   BANKS WARY Swiss banks are urging the authorities to give them more clarity on the rules that apply to cryptocurrency projects before providing services to the market, and at least two important players have withdrawn for now. Zuercher Kantonalbank (ZKB), the fourth largest Swiss bank and one of the few big banks in the world to welcome issuers of cryptocurrencies, has closed the accounts of more than 20 companies in the last year, industry sources told Reuters. A spokesman for ZKB declined to comment on any former or existing clients relationships, but said the bank does not do business with any cryptocurrency groups. Another large Swiss bank kicked out crypto project Smart Valor at around the same time, said a person familiar with the project. The source declined to name the bank. Only a handful of Switzerland's 250 banks ever allowed companies to deposit the cash equivalent of cryptocurrencies raised in ICOs. At least two still do, Reuters has established. But the involvement of a large bank like ZKB helped to establish Switzerland as an early cryptocurrency hub. ZKB and the bank that turned its back on Smart Valor began shutting their doors in October after a management feud severely damaged cryptocurrency project Tezos, which had conducted Zug's largest ICO, entrepreneurs and advisers said.  Swiss banks are worried because some companies that carried out ICOs did not do anti-money laundering (AML) checks on their contributors, industry sources said. This means the banks themselves could fall foul of AML rules.   LIECHTENSTEIN A WINNER ""A cautionary response from Swiss banks resulted in a pause or closure for most projects in the cryptocurrency space,""  said David Henderson, founder of the Swiss Sweetbridge Foundation, set up to conduct blockchain startup Sweetbridge's ICO. Sweetbridge was in the late stages of securing an account with ZKB, but the application was put on hold a few days after the Tezos scandal erupted, Henderson said. The project ultimately decided not to carry out its planned ICO through the Swiss foundation, setting up entities and bank accounts in Gibraltar and Liechtenstein instead. It is difficult for crypto-projects to use the funds they raise through ICOs if they are locked out of the banking system. Funds from ICOs are often originally raised in cryptocurrencies bitcoin and ether, which have limited use as a means of payment in the broader economy. ""I cannot pay salaries because our money is caught up there. We cannot move it,"" said the founder of a Swiss crypto-firm which has had accounts closed at three different banks. The banks have asked the firm to take out its money, but it is unable to do so without first finding another banking relationship, the founder added. At least two Swiss banks are still accepting ICO funds, according to checks by Reuters. These are Banca Zarattini, a small bank in the Italian-language canton Ticino, and Hypothekarbank Lenzburg, a regional lender located between Zurich and Basel, which recently began accepting crypto customers. Banca Zarattini only banks ICO companies with KYC (know-your-customer) and AML procedures that are in compliance with Swiss law, it said. Hypothekarbank Lenzburg said it had started to accept crytocurrency companies and could charge an initial assessment fee of up to 2,500 Swiss francs($2,500). Bank Frick in Liechtenstein has become a popular alternative for Swiss entities struggling to secure accounts. It banks around 160 crypto-enterprises or projects, of which 60 are in the process of setting up an ICO, the bank told Reuters. The bank, however, declined 90 percent of account requests from cryptocurrency companies and only accepts ICOs based onshore in Switzerland or Liechtenstein, it said.   RULES AND REASSURANCES Despite the challenges, Switzerland is working on new rules to reassure banks and encourage them to accept the accounts of cryptocurrency companies. The country has dropped from second place in 2017 to sixth this year in a country ranking of the sum of ICO funds raised,  according to a study published by PwC and the Crypto Valley Association in June. The Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands topped the list. In May, Swiss Finance Minister Ueli Maurer invited FINMA, the central bank and the Swiss Bankers Association (SBA) to a roundtable discussion on bank accounts for cryptocurrencies. After the meeting, the SBA set up a working group to compile a set of checks and conditions that all banks could follow when opening an account for cryptocurrency firms. ""Banks are currently hesitant to open business accounts for companies with particular touchpoints to ICOs and cryptocurrencies - due to risks such as fraud or money laundering,"" SBA said in a statement. Zug finance director Taennler said the aim set out during the meeting, which he attended, was to have a set of FINMA-approved guidelines for assessing prospective cryptocurrency clients by the year-end. FINMA has already issued separate guidelines to spell out how Swiss AML rules and securities regulations apply to various ICOs. But securities rules are less stringent in Switzerland than in the United States, where the Securities and Exchange Commission has toughened its stance on ICOs.  This makes it more risky for banks in Switzerland to be involved with ICO projects which may have raised money from U.S. contributors and could fall under the purview of the SEC. Switzerland's authorities have said they want to create conditions for the country to remain competitive but with no room for scams or financial crime. The finance ministry is also looking at the broader legal framework for blockchain technology and ICOs. Its findings will be presented to the federal government by the end of the year and will determine how the technology fits into existing Swiss laws and regulations.

"    When you were a young'un, your parents may have sat you down   to talk about the ""birds and the bees."" Now it's time to turn the   tables and address another uncomfortable topic: their   finances. Such conversations mark a reversal in the traditional   parent-child dynamic, and also can be fraught with concerns over   independence, trust and mortality. As a result, these talks often   don't happen at all, and a perceived lack of urgency is to blame,   according to a 2018 survey conducted by Wells Fargo. Roughly one-third of parents over the age of 60 say they've   never discussed later-life needs with family, including   inheritance plans, beneficiaries, important documents or   designated representatives, according to the survey. Meanwhile,   adult children worry such conversations will cause conflict or   make it seem as though they're after their parents' money.makeArticleAd(); As daunting as it may seem, it's important to have ""the talk""   about finances with your parents to help protect them from scams   and elder abuse, which cost Americans more than $36 billion each   year, according to financial services firm True Link Financial.   These conversations also ensure that a rapid-response plan is in   place in the event of disability and that there are no surprises   after your parents die, says Ron Long, head of regulatory affairs   and elder client initiatives at Wells Fargo Advisors. These four tips can open lines of communication. 1. Start with one conversation When's a good time to sit your parents down for a hard   conversation about their financial well-being, plans for the   future and important legal and financial documents like a will,   power of attorney or health care directives? The twelfth of   never, for most children. Don't wait for tragedy to strike. A study by Ameriprise   Financial found that a life-altering incident was the trigger for   90% of children who'd actually discussed estate planning with   their parents.  » Unfamiliar with estate planning?     See our   7-step checklist  Instead, carve out time for a family meeting - perhaps on   Mother's Day, Father's Day or the Friday after Thanksgiving -   when all the children are present, Long recommends. ""It's a good   way to get the conversation started and then you can do a   refresher or update down the road."" The first conversation should serve as a door-opener. There   are weighty decisions at play - which may change over time with   your parents' mental or physical health - so don't expect a   one-and-done conversation. 2. Begin with the basics Talking about money inspires reactions ranging from secretive   to forthright. Even if your parents aren't particularly prickly   about discussing their finances, it's prudent to ease into such   conversations. Long says a strategy that's ""very helpful"" is approaching   discussions from a group-planning perspective - sharing what   end-of-life goals you're considering and asking your parents   about theirs. ""Remember, these are subjects that a lot of older   folks hold close to their hearts,"" he says. Be sensitive when starting that initial conversation. Think   less interrogative (how much money's at stake and who gets what?)   and more collaborative (exchanging information about where   accounts are held or who has power of attorney). 3. Broach serious topics Once you've established a rapport, tackle topics that make   either you or your parents uncomfortable, including the morose   (funeral arrangements or declining health) and the dangerous   (financial scams targeting seniors that could wipe out their   savings). Don't let the prospect of an awkward conversation now create a   bigger headache in the future. Strive for this balance:   confronting reality head-on without infantilizing or offending   your parents. A bad way to deal? Shutting down future   conversations when talks are strained. A better way to deal?   Involving other family members to facilitate discussion or   working with a financial advisor to handle trickier topics.

Two of the four patents in the case relate to Prodigy, IBM's late-1980s precursor to the web. IBM's patents describe commonplace internet technology like password management and online advertising. McBride disputed Hadden's assertion that IBM has approached every major web-based company, but said it had engaged in discussions with companies like Yelp Inc  and Airbnb Inc, among others. An IBM spokesman told Reuters it had not reached licensing deals with Yelp and Airbnb. McBride said license fees help it recoup the billions it spends on R&D and reach productive arrangements with other innovative companies. IBM has secured more U.S. patents than any other company for the past 25 years. Earlier on Thursday, McBride described licensing agreements the company has previously struck with Amazon, Facebook, Alphabet's Google, LinkedIn and Twitter, who have paid IBM fees ranging from $20 million to $50 million each. Hadden also questioned McBride about IBM sales to so-called ""patent trolls,"" who hold intellectual property solely for the purpose of filing lawsuits and have been widely criticized in the tech industry. A lawyer for IBM objected to the questioning, saying it was irrelevant, but the judge instructed McBride to answer. McBride said IBM was ""selective"" about who it sells patents to and strikes such deals in part to protect itself from trolls. ""If a patent troll wants to buy a patent from us then we insist on a covenant not to sue IBM,"" McBride said. ""We achieve some level of protection from being sued ourselves.""

These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

"    Tech stocks have seen profits grow double-digits year over year over the last three quarters. A similar winning streak is widely expected this earnings season. And why not? Computer and software makers are having a ball on the back of White House's initiative to trim tax rates, while high-end gaming, emergence of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and automation are driving demand for chips. Let us, thus, keep an eye on tech stocks that are likely to come up with stellar second-quarter earnings numbers.  Tech Stocks Back Most Gains in 2018  More than half of the equity market's gains so far this year have been contributed by tech titans. FAANG stocks, an acronym that refers to Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet, have been mostly treading higher of late. Amazon, for example, has climbed more than 50% so far this year, while Netflix has more than doubled. Ben Carlson, a portfolio manager at Ritholtz Wealth Management, added that Amazon itself accounts for 35% of the S&P 500's year-to-date return and Netflix contributes 21%. Another tech bellwether Microsoft has lately scaled a record high, hitting the coveted $800 billion market cap for the first time. In fact, the much-loved tech sector rallied 14% so far this year, while the S&P 500 went up just 4.2%.  Catalysts Behind the Surge  Tech heavyweights continue to influence the U.S. stock market for good reason. The Republican tax overhaul policy is providing the much-needed windfall to tech companies. The headline-grabbing move lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, while any income brought back from overseas is taxed 8% to 15.5%, instead of the current 35%. This extra cash is helping the companies pursue a combination of share buybacks, dividend payouts and M&A activities. The prospect of a cut in personal taxation is also a major driving force for big tech firms. With more cash in hand, investors have more room to invest. At the same time, IoT, which connects various devices to the cloud, is expected to be a huge growth driver for tech majors. Chip makers, in the meantime, made giant strides as chips are in demand for some of the fastest growing tech industries in the world like e-sports and crypto mining. E-sports, a multiplayer video game for professional gamers, need thousands of semiconductor chips for production. These chips are an essential part of crypto mining as they provide the processing power needed for decoding blockchain algorithms.  Tech's Earnings Party Still Going Strong  As tech companies continue to dominate the equity market, analysts expect tech earnings to be up 23.8% on 10.7% higher revenues in the second quarter, which would follow 31.1% earnings growth on 13.1% revenue rise in the first quarter. And if this happens, it would be the fourth successive quarter that the Information Technology sector of the S&P 500 produced earnings growth of 20% or more. Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, had written to investors that ""net buy ratings of major tech players remain extremely high relative to history."" But, there are concerns for them this earnings season. Tech valuations mostly remain at elevated levels compared to the broader equity market. Needless to say, trade war issues can also affect its global supply chain.  5 Tech Stocks for Q2 Earnings Beat  Most investors are forecasting big gains from chips and big tech companies this earnings season on the back of favorable government policy. This calls for investing in five tech stocks, which are expected to report a significant uptick in second-quarter earnings. These stocks have a positive Earnings ESP  .

The departures, which industry sources fear will continue, mean Switzerland is losing business to offshore rivals including Liechtenstein, Gibraltar and the Cayman Islands, where banks are more welcoming.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','',''); The wealthy Swiss canton of Zug, for example, has been dubbed ""Crypto Valley"", with 200-300 virtual currency entities opening there in recent years. Zug's finance director, Heinz Taennler, says they may leave if the government does not take steps to give them access to the banking system, without which they struggle to function. ""All their banking relationships are going to Liechtenstein,"" he told Reuters. ""These are hundreds of jobs that have been created, and every job is important."" Thomas Moser, an alternate member of the governing board at the Swiss National Bank (SNB), said some cryptocurrency companies had asked the central to intervene. ""They raised concerns about problems with opening bank accounts, which was a worry for them, and asked for help,"" Moser told Reuters. ""I said this was not something the SNB dealt with, but they should speak with FINMA. FINMA, Switzerland's financial market supervisor, has held discussions with the SNB and bankers' association on how to make banks more accessible to cryptocurrency ventures. ""We would not want to close the door on the opportunities that such innovation (cryptocurrencies) might bring,"" Moser added. Providing the legal framework to launch ICOs and for banks to do business with cryptocurrency companies is not easy. The risk of fraud and lack of transparency about who owns cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether have made regulators around the world wary. The United States is among countries that are increasing scrutiny of the sector.   BANKS WARY Swiss banks are urging the authorities to give them more clarity on the rules that apply to cryptocurrency projects before providing services to the market, and at least two important players have withdrawn for now. Zuercher Kantonalbank (ZKB), the fourth largest Swiss bank and one of the few big banks in the world to welcome issuers of cryptocurrencies, has closed the accounts of more than 20 companies in the last year, industry sources told Reuters. A spokesman for ZKB declined to comment on any former or existing clients relationships, but said the bank does not do business with any cryptocurrency groups. Another large Swiss bank kicked out crypto project Smart Valor at around the same time, said a person familiar with the project. The source declined to name the bank. Only a handful of Switzerland's 250 banks ever allowed companies to deposit the cash equivalent of cryptocurrencies raised in ICOs. At least two still do, Reuters has established. But the involvement of a large bank like ZKB helped to establish Switzerland as an early cryptocurrency hub. ZKB and the bank that turned its back on Smart Valor began shutting their doors in October after a management feud severely damaged cryptocurrency project Tezos, which had conducted Zug's largest ICO, entrepreneurs and advisers said.  Swiss banks are worried because some companies that carried out ICOs did not do anti-money laundering (AML) checks on their contributors, industry sources said. This means the banks themselves could fall foul of AML rules.   LIECHTENSTEIN A WINNER ""A cautionary response from Swiss banks resulted in a pause or closure for most projects in the cryptocurrency space,""  said David Henderson, founder of the Swiss Sweetbridge Foundation, set up to conduct blockchain startup Sweetbridge's ICO. Sweetbridge was in the late stages of securing an account with ZKB, but the application was put on hold a few days after the Tezos scandal erupted, Henderson said. The project ultimately decided not to carry out its planned ICO through the Swiss foundation, setting up entities and bank accounts in Gibraltar and Liechtenstein instead. It is difficult for crypto-projects to use the funds they raise through ICOs if they are locked out of the banking system. Funds from ICOs are often originally raised in cryptocurrencies bitcoin and ether, which have limited use as a means of payment in the broader economy. ""I cannot pay salaries because our money is caught up there. We cannot move it,"" said the founder of a Swiss crypto-firm which has had accounts closed at three different banks. The banks have asked the firm to take out its money, but it is unable to do so without first finding another banking relationship, the founder added. At least two Swiss banks are still accepting ICO funds, according to checks by Reuters. These are Banca Zarattini, a small bank in the Italian-language canton Ticino, and Hypothekarbank Lenzburg, a regional lender located between Zurich and Basel, which recently began accepting crypto customers. Banca Zarattini only banks ICO companies with KYC (know-your-customer) and AML procedures that are in compliance with Swiss law, it said. Hypothekarbank Lenzburg said it had started to accept crytocurrency companies and could charge an initial assessment fee of up to 2,500 Swiss francs($2,500). Bank Frick in Liechtenstein has become a popular alternative for Swiss entities struggling to secure accounts. It banks around 160 crypto-enterprises or projects, of which 60 are in the process of setting up an ICO, the bank told Reuters. The bank, however, declined 90 percent of account requests from cryptocurrency companies and only accepts ICOs based onshore in Switzerland or Liechtenstein, it said.   RULES AND REASSURANCES Despite the challenges, Switzerland is working on new rules to reassure banks and encourage them to accept the accounts of cryptocurrency companies. The country has dropped from second place in 2017 to sixth this year in a country ranking of the sum of ICO funds raised,  according to a study published by PwC and the Crypto Valley Association in June. The Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands topped the list. In May, Swiss Finance Minister Ueli Maurer invited FINMA, the central bank and the Swiss Bankers Association (SBA) to a roundtable discussion on bank accounts for cryptocurrencies. After the meeting, the SBA set up a working group to compile a set of checks and conditions that all banks could follow when opening an account for cryptocurrency firms. ""Banks are currently hesitant to open business accounts for companies with particular touchpoints to ICOs and cryptocurrencies - due to risks such as fraud or money laundering,"" SBA said in a statement. Zug finance director Taennler said the aim set out during the meeting, which he attended, was to have a set of FINMA-approved guidelines for assessing prospective cryptocurrency clients by the year-end. FINMA has already issued separate guidelines to spell out how Swiss AML rules and securities regulations apply to various ICOs. But securities rules are less stringent in Switzerland than in the United States, where the Securities and Exchange Commission has toughened its stance on ICOs.  This makes it more risky for banks in Switzerland to be involved with ICO projects which may have raised money from U.S. contributors and could fall under the purview of the SEC. Switzerland's authorities have said they want to create conditions for the country to remain competitive but with no room for scams or financial crime. The finance ministry is also looking at the broader legal framework for blockchain technology and ICOs. Its findings will be presented to the federal government by the end of the year and will determine how the technology fits into existing Swiss laws and regulations.

"    When you were a young'un, your parents may have sat you down   to talk about the ""birds and the bees."" Now it's time to turn the   tables and address another uncomfortable topic: their   finances. Such conversations mark a reversal in the traditional   parent-child dynamic, and also can be fraught with concerns over   independence, trust and mortality. As a result, these talks often   don't happen at all, and a perceived lack of urgency is to blame,   according to a 2018 survey conducted by Wells Fargo. Roughly one-third of parents over the age of 60 say they've   never discussed later-life needs with family, including   inheritance plans, beneficiaries, important documents or   designated representatives, according to the survey. Meanwhile,   adult children worry such conversations will cause conflict or   make it seem as though they're after their parents' money.makeArticleAd(); As daunting as it may seem, it's important to have ""the talk""   about finances with your parents to help protect them from scams   and elder abuse, which cost Americans more than $36 billion each   year, according to financial services firm True Link Financial.   These conversations also ensure that a rapid-response plan is in   place in the event of disability and that there are no surprises   after your parents die, says Ron Long, head of regulatory affairs   and elder client initiatives at Wells Fargo Advisors. These four tips can open lines of communication. 1. Start with one conversation When's a good time to sit your parents down for a hard   conversation about their financial well-being, plans for the   future and important legal and financial documents like a will,   power of attorney or health care directives? The twelfth of   never, for most children. Don't wait for tragedy to strike. A study by Ameriprise   Financial found that a life-altering incident was the trigger for   90% of children who'd actually discussed estate planning with   their parents.  » Unfamiliar with estate planning?     See our   7-step checklist  Instead, carve out time for a family meeting - perhaps on   Mother's Day, Father's Day or the Friday after Thanksgiving -   when all the children are present, Long recommends. ""It's a good   way to get the conversation started and then you can do a   refresher or update down the road."" The first conversation should serve as a door-opener. There   are weighty decisions at play - which may change over time with   your parents' mental or physical health - so don't expect a   one-and-done conversation. 2. Begin with the basics Talking about money inspires reactions ranging from secretive   to forthright. Even if your parents aren't particularly prickly   about discussing their finances, it's prudent to ease into such   conversations. Long says a strategy that's ""very helpful"" is approaching   discussions from a group-planning perspective - sharing what   end-of-life goals you're considering and asking your parents   about theirs. ""Remember, these are subjects that a lot of older   folks hold close to their hearts,"" he says. Be sensitive when starting that initial conversation. Think   less interrogative (how much money's at stake and who gets what?)   and more collaborative (exchanging information about where   accounts are held or who has power of attorney). 3. Broach serious topics Once you've established a rapport, tackle topics that make   either you or your parents uncomfortable, including the morose   (funeral arrangements or declining health) and the dangerous   (financial scams targeting seniors that could wipe out their   savings). Don't let the prospect of an awkward conversation now create a   bigger headache in the future. Strive for this balance:   confronting reality head-on without infantilizing or offending   your parents. A bad way to deal? Shutting down future   conversations when talks are strained. A better way to deal?   Involving other family members to facilitate discussion or   working with a financial advisor to handle trickier topics. (Here   are some tips on   choosing a financial advisor    .) 4. Leave judgment at the door Conversations with your parents may reveal wildly different   opinions about how to handle finances. You're asking them to part   with sensitive information; promise a judgment-free zone in   return. Because of the prevalence of financial abuse - it's estimated   one in five elders have been impacted - urge your parents to flag   potential scams.

"    On Jul 16, we issued an updated research report on TripAdvisor, Inc. TRIP  . TripAdvisor is witnessing secular growth trends in the online travel space. The company's solid performance in the non-hotel business, expansion into the international restaurant reservation space, new partnerships, better cost control and favorable foreign currency are positives. Additionally, TripAdvisor's increasing interest in the food delivery space will add to top-line growth. TripAdvisor's stock has gained 56.2% in the past 12 months, outperforming the 44.4% rally of the industry  it belongs to.     Key Factors  TripAdvisor continues to benefit from its rapidly expanding user base. Its rich content helps travelers choose from more than 1.5 million places, thus increasing the user base. TripAdvisor's business model is primarily driven by the number of unique visitors to its website and therefore an increase in the number of visitors is an important indicator of its future growth. The company's focus on food delivery space is a big positive. Recently, TripAdvisor added another food-delivery service, delivery.com, to its offerings. It entered into a partnership with delivery.com to incorporate food-ordering service into its restaurant listings. The tie-up will help travelers order meals from restaurants directly from TripAdvisor's desktop or mobile platform. The recent deal will help TripAdvisor further expand its user base. TripAdvisor's Instant Booking initiative is gaining a lot of momentum. The initiative allows travelers to book a hotel through TripAdvisor's booking partners on its mobile site or apps.These initiatives will boost the world's largest online travel research company's user base and conversion rates as users are now more likely to click on advertisers' links for booking rather than gathering information. Additionally, TripAdvisor's Mobile Platform continues to perform well and the company is constantly updating its mobile products. As a result, mobile traffic has been increasing at a healthy rate. Nowadays, smartphones are increasingly being used, along with laptops and tablets to share travel experiences through social networking sites.

"     Amazon AMZN  is leaving no stone unturned to fortify presence in the healthcare sector.  makeArticleAd();  Reportedly, the company is in talks with a Seattle-based start-up called Xealth to work on a project related to medical supplies. Notably, the start-up assists the patients to manage their health with the aid of its digital health tools and prescriptions.    The pilot project also welcomes the participation of two hospitals namely Providence Health Systems and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. In fact, both these institutions have invested in Xealth.    Amazon is striving to make the patient's access to medical supplies easier and comfortable with the help of this project. Notably, this project will allow the doctors to prescribe medical products necessary for their patients after a surgery or in general cases through the hospital's online portal.    This will enable the patients to place a purchase order for the items that their doctor has recommended just by logging into their personal page on the hospital portal. The patients will then get them delivered at their doors via Amazon's efficient delivery system.   Medical Supply Market to Benefit    We believe the latest move of the company serves the interests of the patients to a great extent and of the doctors as well, which will be beneficial for the healthcare sector.    Further, it is in sync with its strategy of bolstering presence in the medical supplies market.    Per the report from Energias Market Research, the global market for medical supplies is expected to reach $140.5 billion by 2023 by growing at a CAGR of 6.3% between 2017 and 2023.    Amazon is well poised to reap benefits from this growing market on the back of its aggressive retail strategies and robust e-commerce platform.    Additionally, new parents and patients with severe illness who require medical support quite often are likely to be attracted by the new project.    Moreover, the company might integrate the online pharmacy supply into this project with the help of PillPack.    All these endeavors are likely to bring more customers to the company's platform, driving its top-line growth in this sector.    Coming to the price performance, shares of Amazon have returned 53.6% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the industry  's rally of 30.6%.        Growing Focus on Healthcare Sector    Amazon's strong efforts toward healthcare sector will help it to gain momentum in the sector. The recent move holds a lot of potential for future growth.    Recently, the company ventured into the high-potential pharmaceutical industry with the PillPack acquisition. Upon the completion of this buyout, Amazon would be selling prescription medicines online.    Further, the company teamed up with Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase for a healthcare venture in order to bring down health-care costs and improve facilities for their U.S. employees.    Additionally, a team has been built within the company's Alexa division to focus more on health & wellness with the help of its voice assistant. This has strengthened the company's presence in the digital healthcare sector.    Consequently, Amazon's e-commerce platform is completely ready to disrupt this sector. These strong efforts will help the company to expand its benefits from this particular sector which holds immense growth potential.   Amazon.com, Inc. Revenue (TTM)      Amazon.com, Inc.

"     TripAdvisor, Inc. TRIP  has been upgraded by Barclays' analyst Deepak Mathivanan. The analyst upgraded TripAdvisor stock from an equalweight to overweight rating. Also, he raised the target price by 43% to $70 on the stock, prompting an increase of 1.9% in share price. Notably, the stock has outperformed the industry it belongs to over the past year. It has gained 57.1% compared with the industry  's rally of 43.1%.     Why the Upgrade?  The analyst believes that TripAdvisor is witnessing secular growth trends in the online travel space. The company's monetization rates seem to be on track and should grow in the to-be-reported quarter. Improving user experience in both mobile and desktop is a big positive going forward. Mathivanan said, ""We expect TRIP's mobile traffic to soon inflect from being a headwind to a tailwind on overall monetization rates, as mobile overtakes desktop in hotel shoppers sometime in early 2019."" In addition, Mathivanan remains positive about the company's non-hotel segment. In the last reported quarter, revenues in the non-hotel segment increased 37% year over year and contributed to 21% of the total revenues. This segment includes revenues from attractions, restaurants and vacation rental businesses.  Conclusion  TripAdvisor's growth is being driven by strong performance in the company's non-hotel business, better cost control, improving monetization rates and favorable foreign currency. Its improvement in user growth and engagement can be accredited to growth initiatives like Meta search & Instant Booking, as well as strong focus on developing its mobile products. Expansion into the international restaurant reservation space, solid fundamentals and boosting hotel bookings from partnerships are likely to help the company in achieving desired results.

"Reuters  @media screen and (max-device-width: 480px){body{ font-size:30pt !important;}}    By Anna Irrera and Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi NEW YORK/ZURICH, July 19 (Reuters) - Swiss regulators are stepping up efforts to halt an exodus of cryptocurrency projects from the country, after two of only a handful of banks active in the nascent sector shut their doors on it in the last year. The departures, which industry sources fear will continue, mean Switzerland is losing business to offshore rivals including Liechtenstein, Gibraltar and the Cayman Islands, where banks are more welcoming.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','',''); The wealthy Swiss canton of Zug, for example, has been dubbed ""Crypto Valley"", with 200-300 virtual currency entities opening there in recent years. Zug's finance director, Heinz Taennler, says they may leave if the government does not take steps to give them access to the banking system, without which they struggle to function. ""All their banking relationships are going to Liechtenstein,"" he told Reuters. ""These are hundreds of jobs that have been created, and every job is important."" Thomas Moser, an alternate member of the governing board at the Swiss National Bank (SNB), said some cryptocurrency companies had asked the central to intervene. ""They raised concerns about problems with opening bank accounts, which was a worry for them, and asked for help,"" Moser told Reuters. ""I said this was not something the SNB dealt with, but they should speak with FINMA. FINMA, Switzerland's financial market supervisor, has held discussions with the SNB and bankers' association on how to make banks more accessible to cryptocurrency ventures. ""We would not want to close the door on the opportunities that such innovation (cryptocurrencies) might bring,"" Moser added. Providing the legal framework to launch ICOs and for banks to do business with cryptocurrency companies is not easy. The risk of fraud and lack of transparency about who owns cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether have made regulators around the world wary. The United States is among countries that are increasing scrutiny of the sector.   BANKS WARY Swiss banks are urging the authorities to give them more clarity on the rules that apply to cryptocurrency projects before providing services to the market, and at least two important players have withdrawn for now. Zuercher Kantonalbank (ZKB), the fourth largest Swiss bank and one of the few big banks in the world to welcome issuers of cryptocurrencies, has closed the accounts of more than 20 companies in the last year, industry sources told Reuters. A spokesman for ZKB declined to comment on any former or existing clients relationships, but said the bank does not do business with any cryptocurrency groups. Another large Swiss bank kicked out crypto project Smart Valor at around the same time, said a person familiar with the project. The source declined to name the bank. Only a handful of Switzerland's 250 banks ever allowed companies to deposit the cash equivalent of cryptocurrencies raised in ICOs. At least two still do, Reuters has established. But the involvement of a large bank like ZKB helped to establish Switzerland as an early cryptocurrency hub. ZKB and the bank that turned its back on Smart Valor began shutting their doors in October after a management feud severely damaged cryptocurrency project Tezos, which had conducted Zug's largest ICO, entrepreneurs and advisers said.  Swiss banks are worried because some companies that carried out ICOs did not do anti-money laundering (AML) checks on their contributors, industry sources said. This means the banks themselves could fall foul of AML rules.   LIECHTENSTEIN A WINNER ""A cautionary response from Swiss banks resulted in a pause or closure for most projects in the cryptocurrency space,""  said David Henderson, founder of the Swiss Sweetbridge Foundation, set up to conduct blockchain startup Sweetbridge's ICO. Sweetbridge was in the late stages of securing an account with ZKB, but the application was put on hold a few days after the Tezos scandal erupted, Henderson said. The project ultimately decided not to carry out its planned ICO through the Swiss foundation, setting up entities and bank accounts in Gibraltar and Liechtenstein instead. It is difficult for crypto-projects to use the funds they raise through ICOs if they are locked out of the banking system. Funds from ICOs are often originally raised in cryptocurrencies bitcoin and ether, which have limited use as a means of payment in the broader economy. ""I cannot pay salaries because our money is caught up there. We cannot move it,"" said the founder of a Swiss crypto-firm which has had accounts closed at three different banks. The banks have asked the firm to take out its money, but it is unable to do so without first finding another banking relationship, the founder added. At least two Swiss banks are still accepting ICO funds, according to checks by Reuters. These are Banca Zarattini, a small bank in the Italian-language canton Ticino, and Hypothekarbank Lenzburg, a regional lender located between Zurich and Basel, which recently began accepting crypto customers. Banca Zarattini only banks ICO companies with KYC (know-your-customer) and AML procedures that are in compliance with Swiss law, it said. Hypothekarbank Lenzburg said it had started to accept crytocurrency companies and could charge an initial assessment fee of up to 2,500 Swiss francs($2,500). Bank Frick in Liechtenstein has become a popular alternative for Swiss entities struggling to secure accounts. It banks around 160 crypto-enterprises or projects, of which 60 are in the process of setting up an ICO, the bank told Reuters. The bank, however, declined 90 percent of account requests from cryptocurrency companies and only accepts ICOs based onshore in Switzerland or Liechtenstein, it said.   RULES AND REASSURANCES Despite the challenges, Switzerland is working on new rules to reassure banks and encourage them to accept the accounts of cryptocurrency companies. The country has dropped from second place in 2017 to sixth this year in a country ranking of the sum of ICO funds raised,  according to a study published by PwC and the Crypto Valley Association in June. The Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands topped the list. In May, Swiss Finance Minister Ueli Maurer invited FINMA, the central bank and the Swiss Bankers Association (SBA) to a roundtable discussion on bank accounts for cryptocurrencies. After the meeting, the SBA set up a working group to compile a set of checks and conditions that all banks could follow when opening an account for cryptocurrency firms. ""Banks are currently hesitant to open business accounts for companies with particular touchpoints to ICOs and cryptocurrencies - due to risks such as fraud or money laundering,"" SBA said in a statement. Zug finance director Taennler said the aim set out during the meeting, which he attended, was to have a set of FINMA-approved guidelines for assessing prospective cryptocurrency clients by the year-end. FINMA has already issued separate guidelines to spell out how Swiss AML rules and securities regulations apply to various ICOs. But securities rules are less stringent in Switzerland than in the United States, where the Securities and Exchange Commission has toughened its stance on ICOs.  This makes it more risky for banks in Switzerland to be involved with ICO projects which may have raised money from U.S. contributors and could fall under the purview of the SEC. Switzerland's authorities have said they want to create conditions for the country to remain competitive but with no room for scams or financial crime. The finance ministry is also looking at the broader legal framework for blockchain technology and ICOs. Its findings will be presented to the federal government by the end of the year and will determine how the technology fits into existing Swiss laws and regulations.

"Reuters  @media screen and (max-device-width: 480px){body{ font-size:30pt !important;}}    By Anna Irrera and Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi NEW YORK/ZURICH, July 19 (Reuters) - Swiss regulators are stepping up efforts to halt an exodus of cryptocurrency projects from the country, after two of only a handful of banks active in the nascent sector shut their doors on it in the last year. The departures, which industry sources fear will continue, mean Switzerland is losing business to offshore rivals including Liechtenstein, Gibraltar and the Cayman Islands, where banks are more welcoming.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','',''); The wealthy Swiss canton of Zug, for example, has been dubbed ""Crypto Valley"", with 200-300 virtual currency entities opening there in recent years. Zug's finance director, Heinz Taennler, says they may leave if the government does not take steps to give them access to the banking system, without which they struggle to function. ""All their banking relationships are going to Liechtenstein,"" he told Reuters. ""These are hundreds of jobs that have been created, and every job is important."" Thomas Moser, an alternate member of the governing board at the Swiss National Bank (SNB), said some cryptocurrency companies had asked the central to intervene. ""They raised concerns about problems with opening bank accounts, which was a worry for them, and asked for help,"" Moser told Reuters. ""I said this was not something the SNB dealt with, but they should speak with FINMA. FINMA, Switzerland's financial market supervisor, has held discussions with the SNB and bankers' association on how to make banks more accessible to cryptocurrency ventures. ""We would not want to close the door on the opportunities that such innovation (cryptocurrencies) might bring,"" Moser added. Providing the legal framework to launch ICOs and for banks to do business with cryptocurrency companies is not easy. The risk of fraud and lack of transparency about who owns cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether have made regulators around the world wary. The United States is among countries that are increasing scrutiny of the sector.   BANKS WARY Swiss banks are urging the authorities to give them more clarity on the rules that apply to cryptocurrency projects before providing services to the market, and at least two important players have withdrawn for now. Zuercher Kantonalbank (ZKB), the fourth largest Swiss bank and one of the few big banks in the world to welcome issuers of cryptocurrencies, has closed the accounts of more than 20 companies in the last year, industry sources told Reuters. A spokesman for ZKB declined to comment on any former or existing clients relationships, but said the bank does not do business with any cryptocurrency groups. Another large Swiss bank kicked out crypto project Smart Valor at around the same time, said a person familiar with the project. The source declined to name the bank. Only a handful of Switzerland's 250 banks ever allowed companies to deposit the cash equivalent of cryptocurrencies raised in ICOs. At least two still do, Reuters has established. But the involvement of a large bank like ZKB helped to establish Switzerland as an early cryptocurrency hub. ZKB and the bank that turned its back on Smart Valor began shutting their doors in October after a management feud severely damaged cryptocurrency project Tezos, which had conducted Zug's largest ICO, entrepreneurs and advisers said.

"    When you were a young'un, your parents may have sat you down   to talk about the ""birds and the bees."" Now it's time to turn the   tables and address another uncomfortable topic: their   finances. Such conversations mark a reversal in the traditional   parent-child dynamic, and also can be fraught with concerns over   independence, trust and mortality. As a result, these talks often   don't happen at all, and a perceived lack of urgency is to blame,   according to a 2018 survey conducted by Wells Fargo. Roughly one-third of parents over the age of 60 say they've   never discussed later-life needs with family, including   inheritance plans, beneficiaries, important documents or   designated representatives, according to the survey. Meanwhile,   adult children worry such conversations will cause conflict or   make it seem as though they're after their parents' money.makeArticleAd(); As daunting as it may seem, it's important to have ""the talk""   about finances with your parents to help protect them from scams   and elder abuse, which cost Americans more than $36 billion each   year, according to financial services firm True Link Financial.   These conversations also ensure that a rapid-response plan is in   place in the event of disability and that there are no surprises   after your parents die, says Ron Long, head of regulatory affairs   and elder client initiatives at Wells Fargo Advisors. These four tips can open lines of communication. 1. Start with one conversation When's a good time to sit your parents down for a hard   conversation about their financial well-being, plans for the   future and important legal and financial documents like a will,   power of attorney or health care directives? The twelfth of   never, for most children. Don't wait for tragedy to strike. A study by Ameriprise   Financial found that a life-altering incident was the trigger for   90% of children who'd actually discussed estate planning with   their parents.  » Unfamiliar with estate planning?     See our   7-step checklist  Instead, carve out time for a family meeting - perhaps on   Mother's Day, Father's Day or the Friday after Thanksgiving -   when all the children are present, Long recommends. ""It's a good   way to get the conversation started and then you can do a   refresher or update down the road."" The first conversation should serve as a door-opener. There   are weighty decisions at play - which may change over time with   your parents' mental or physical health - so don't expect a   one-and-done conversation. 2. Begin with the basics Talking about money inspires reactions ranging from secretive   to forthright. Even if your parents aren't particularly prickly   about discussing their finances, it's prudent to ease into such   conversations. Long says a strategy that's ""very helpful"" is approaching   discussions from a group-planning perspective - sharing what   end-of-life goals you're considering and asking your parents   about theirs. ""Remember, these are subjects that a lot of older   folks hold close to their hearts,"" he says. Be sensitive when starting that initial conversation. Think   less interrogative (how much money's at stake and who gets what?)   and more collaborative (exchanging information about where   accounts are held or who has power of attorney). 3. Broach serious topics Once you've established a rapport, tackle topics that make   either you or your parents uncomfortable, including the morose   (funeral arrangements or declining health) and the dangerous   (financial scams targeting seniors that could wipe out their   savings). Don't let the prospect of an awkward conversation now create a   bigger headache in the future. Strive for this balance:   confronting reality head-on without infantilizing or offending   your parents. A bad way to deal? Shutting down future   conversations when talks are strained. A better way to deal?   Involving other family members to facilitate discussion or   working with a financial advisor to handle trickier topics. (Here   are some tips on   choosing a financial advisor    .) 4. Leave judgment at the door Conversations with your parents may reveal wildly different   opinions about how to handle finances. You're asking them to part   with sensitive information; promise a judgment-free zone in   return. Because of the prevalence of financial abuse - it's estimated   one in five elders have been impacted - urge your parents to flag   potential scams. Avoid shaming them for ill-advised financial   decisions or falling victim to fraud.

"What happened Shares of   Under Armour    (NYSE: UAA) (NYSE: UA) climbed 55.8% across the first half of   2018, according to data from      S&P Global Market Intelligence    . After big sell-offs in 2106 and 2017, the footwear and apparel   company's stock rebounded in response to two solid quarterly   reports, new product unveilings, and some changes to the   company's management structure.          UAA    data by   YCharts. makeArticleAd(); Under Armour published its   fourth-quarter    report on Feb. 12 and its   first-quarter    report on May 1. Sales and earnings for both periods came in   ahead of Wall Street's expectations.   Image source: Under Armour. So what The two quarterly reports published by Under Armour in 2018   showed a return to sales growth and painted the picture of a   stabilizing business in the U.S. market. In May, the company   unveiled additional versions of Golden State Warriors star   Stephen Curry's latest shoe line, and it was also revealed that   Under Armour president Patrik Frisk had purchased $500,000 of   company stock. Shares then continued to gain ground in June following the   courtside debut of the new color editions for the latest version   of Curry's signature shoe line: the Curry 5. Under Armour then   benefited from the Warriors' dominant performance in the NBA   Finals. It was the third championship in the last four seasons for   Curry and the Warriors. The team's stacked roster and dominant   performance against the Cleveland Cavaliers suggest there's a   good chance that Golden State will return to the finals next year   and continue to put up strong performances. Curry is Under   Armour's most important celebrity endorser, so if he sustains his   high profile, it's good news for the company. Now what Under Armour's stock price has cooled off a bit in July.

"   Investors in Under Armour Inc (Symbol: UA) saw new options become available today, for the August 31st expiration. At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the UA options chain for the new August 31st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.    The put contract at the $20.50 strike price has a current bid of $1.45. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $20.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $19.05 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of UA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $20.71/share today.     Because the $20.50 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.07% return on the cash commitment, or 51.63% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost .makeArticleAd();    Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Under Armour Inc, and highlighting in green where the $20.50 strike is located relative to that history:         Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $21.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.50. If an investor was to purchase shares of UA stock at the current price level of $20.71/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $21.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.64% if the stock gets called away at the August 31st expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if UA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Under Armour Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing UA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $21.00 strike highlighted in red:     Considering the fact that the $21.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 48%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.24% boost of extra return to the investor, or 52.87% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost .    The implied volatility in the put contract example is 60%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 62%.         Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $20.71) to be 52%.

"In this segment from the    Motley Fool Money     podcast, host Chris Hill and senior Motley Fool analysts Jason   Moser, Matt Argersinger, and Ron Gross consider the situation at   sneaker and athletic-gear giant   Nike    (NYSE: NKE) , which snapped a yearlong streak of quarterly   declines in North American sales this time around, and posted   beats in revenue and EPS. The Fools discuss the competitive   landscape in this apparel niche, as well as the neighboring   athleisure segment. A full transcript follows the video.   10 stocks we like better than Nike       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,     Motley Fool Stock Advisor      , has quadrupled the market.*makeArticleAd(); David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the      10 best stocks       for investors to buy right now... and Nike wasn't one of them!     That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better     buys.   Click here       to learn about these picks!  *Stock Advisor returns as of June 4, 2018         This video was recorded on June 29, 2018.   Chris Hill:    With the World Cup as our backdrop, let's start the week with   Nike. For the first time in a year, Nike posted sales growth in   North America. That was the highlight of its fourth quarter   report. Shares of Nike up big on Friday, and Matty, hitting a new   all-time high.  Matt Argersinger:    Yeah, all-around awesome result for investors, I would say.   Revenue growth of 13%, well above guidance, earnings per share   above guidance. Total Nike brand revenue up 14%, particularly   strong internationally, with China up 35%. But --  Ron Gross:    Trump will take care of that.  Argersinger:    [laughs] Of course. It really was about North America. Growth of   3% might not seem like a barn-burning quarter, but if you think   about the amount of pessimism out there about sports apparel, I   feel like investors probably thought, ""It's either going to be   flat or down."" Nike talked about having growth resurging in the   second half, but I think this is earlier than expected. I think a   lot of investors are saying, ""Hey, I think the trajectory is now   up again.""  Hill:    And to the extent that there's been optimism in sports apparel,   it hasn't been with Nike and it hasn't been with   Under Armour    (NYSE: UA) (NYSE: UAA) , it's really been about   Adidas    lately.  Argersinger:    That's right. Speaking of Under Armour, I was surprised that   Under Armour was actually down on Friday. I thought there would   be some sympathy buying there. But, like you said, Adidas was   winning last year, and there's this idea that maybe this is just   a bit of a zero-sum game right now.  Gross:    Where's the line between sports apparel and athleisure, the   pretentious athleisure? Is there a differentiation between the   two?  Argersinger:    I think there is. I use   Lululemon    as an example, Lululemon has just been on fire. I think that   category feels a little broader than what you'd expect with Nike,   which is more performance apparel.  Jason Moser:    I think it's going to be really interesting to see how Under   Armour reports this coming quarter. I think you're right, it's   that return to growth in North America that made the difference   for Nike this quarter. That has been a big point of weakness for   Under Armour here recently. But Under Armour has also been hampered by some very   self-inflicted wounds, as well. Inventory management was a major   problem. Kevin Plank, I think, took a step back, realized he had   to bring some leadership into play to help him manage this   business and take it to the next level. It's going to be very   fascinating to see not only where Under Armour stands in North   America, but also, are they working through this inventory snafu   and getting the business back in the right direction.

"   Investors in Under Armour Inc (Symbol: UA) saw new options become available today, for the August 24th expiration. At Stock Options Channel  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the UA options chain for the new August 24th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.    The put contract at the $20.50 strike price has a current bid of $1.30. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $20.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $19.20 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of UA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $20.80/share today. Because the $20.50 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 100%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.34% return on the cash commitment, or 46.29% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost  .  makeArticleAd();  Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Under Armour Inc, and highlighting in green where the $20.50 strike is located relative to that history:       Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $21.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.60. If an investor was to purchase shares of UA stock at the current price level of $20.80/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $21.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.65% if the stock gets called away at the August 24th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if UA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Under Armour Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing UA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $21.00 strike highlighted in red:    Considering the fact that the $21.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

"Reuters  @media screen and (max-device-width: 480px){body{ font-size:30pt !important;}}    By Anna Irrera and Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi NEW YORK/ZURICH, July 19 (Reuters) - Swiss regulators are stepping up efforts to halt an exodus of cryptocurrency projects from the country, after two of only a handful of banks active in the nascent sector shut their doors on it in the last year. The departures, which industry sources fear will continue, mean Switzerland is losing business to offshore rivals including Liechtenstein, Gibraltar and the Cayman Islands, where banks are more welcoming.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','',''); The wealthy Swiss canton of Zug, for example, has been dubbed ""Crypto Valley"", with 200-300 virtual currency entities opening there in recent years. Zug's finance director, Heinz Taennler, says they may leave if the government does not take steps to give them access to the banking system, without which they struggle to function. ""All their banking relationships are going to Liechtenstein,"" he told Reuters. ""These are hundreds of jobs that have been created, and every job is important."" Thomas Moser, an alternate member of the governing board at the Swiss National Bank (SNB), said some cryptocurrency companies had asked the central to intervene. ""They raised concerns about problems with opening bank accounts, which was a worry for them, and asked for help,"" Moser told Reuters. ""I said this was not something the SNB dealt with, but they should speak with FINMA. FINMA, Switzerland's financial market supervisor, has held discussions with the SNB and bankers' association on how to make banks more accessible to cryptocurrency ventures. ""We would not want to close the door on the opportunities that such innovation (cryptocurrencies) might bring,"" Moser added. Providing the legal framework to launch ICOs and for banks to do business with cryptocurrency companies is not easy. The risk of fraud and lack of transparency about who owns cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether have made regulators around the world wary. The United States is among countries that are increasing scrutiny of the sector.   BANKS WARY Swiss banks are urging the authorities to give them more clarity on the rules that apply to cryptocurrency projects before providing services to the market, and at least two important players have withdrawn for now. Zuercher Kantonalbank (ZKB), the fourth largest Swiss bank and one of the few big banks in the world to welcome issuers of cryptocurrencies, has closed the accounts of more than 20 companies in the last year, industry sources told Reuters. A spokesman for ZKB declined to comment on any former or existing clients relationships, but said the bank does not do business with any cryptocurrency groups. Another large Swiss bank kicked out crypto project Smart Valor at around the same time, said a person familiar with the project. The source declined to name the bank. Only a handful of Switzerland's 250 banks ever allowed companies to deposit the cash equivalent of cryptocurrencies raised in ICOs. At least two still do, Reuters has established. But the involvement of a large bank like ZKB helped to establish Switzerland as an early cryptocurrency hub. ZKB and the bank that turned its back on Smart Valor began shutting their doors in October after a management feud severely damaged cryptocurrency project Tezos, which had conducted Zug's largest ICO, entrepreneurs and advisers said.  Swiss banks are worried because some companies that carried out ICOs did not do anti-money laundering (AML) checks on their contributors, industry sources said. This means the banks themselves could fall foul of AML rules.   LIECHTENSTEIN A WINNER ""A cautionary response from Swiss banks resulted in a pause or closure for most projects in the cryptocurrency space,""  said David Henderson, founder of the Swiss Sweetbridge Foundation, set up to conduct blockchain startup Sweetbridge's ICO. Sweetbridge was in the late stages of securing an account with ZKB, but the application was put on hold a few days after the Tezos scandal erupted, Henderson said. The project ultimately decided not to carry out its planned ICO through the Swiss foundation, setting up entities and bank accounts in Gibraltar and Liechtenstein instead. It is difficult for crypto-projects to use the funds they raise through ICOs if they are locked out of the banking system. Funds from ICOs are often originally raised in cryptocurrencies bitcoin and ether, which have limited use as a means of payment in the broader economy. ""I cannot pay salaries because our money is caught up there. We cannot move it,"" said the founder of a Swiss crypto-firm which has had accounts closed at three different banks. The banks have asked the firm to take out its money, but it is unable to do so without first finding another banking relationship, the founder added. At least two Swiss banks are still accepting ICO funds, according to checks by Reuters. These are Banca Zarattini, a small bank in the Italian-language canton Ticino, and Hypothekarbank Lenzburg, a regional lender located between Zurich and Basel, which recently began accepting crypto customers. Banca Zarattini only banks ICO companies with KYC (know-your-customer) and AML procedures that are in compliance with Swiss law, it said. Hypothekarbank Lenzburg said it had started to accept crytocurrency companies and could charge an initial assessment fee of up to 2,500 Swiss francs($2,500). Bank Frick in Liechtenstein has become a popular alternative for Swiss entities struggling to secure accounts. It banks around 160 crypto-enterprises or projects, of which 60 are in the process of setting up an ICO, the bank told Reuters. The bank, however, declined 90 percent of account requests from cryptocurrency companies and only accepts ICOs based onshore in Switzerland or Liechtenstein, it said.   RULES AND REASSURANCES Despite the challenges, Switzerland is working on new rules to reassure banks and encourage them to accept the accounts of cryptocurrency companies. The country has dropped from second place in 2017 to sixth this year in a country ranking of the sum of ICO funds raised,  according to a study published by PwC and the Crypto Valley Association in June. The Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands topped the list. In May, Swiss Finance Minister Ueli Maurer invited FINMA, the central bank and the Swiss Bankers Association (SBA) to a roundtable discussion on bank accounts for cryptocurrencies. After the meeting, the SBA set up a working group to compile a set of checks and conditions that all banks could follow when opening an account for cryptocurrency firms. ""Banks are currently hesitant to open business accounts for companies with particular touchpoints to ICOs and cryptocurrencies - due to risks such as fraud or money laundering,"" SBA said in a statement. Zug finance director Taennler said the aim set out during the meeting, which he attended, was to have a set of FINMA-approved guidelines for assessing prospective cryptocurrency clients by the year-end. FINMA has already issued separate guidelines to spell out how Swiss AML rules and securities regulations apply to various ICOs. But securities rules are less stringent in Switzerland than in the United States, where the Securities and Exchange Commission has toughened its stance on ICOs.  This makes it more risky for banks in Switzerland to be involved with ICO projects which may have raised money from U.S. contributors and could fall under the purview of the SEC. Switzerland's authorities have said they want to create conditions for the country to remain competitive but with no room for scams or financial crime. The finance ministry is also looking at the broader legal framework for blockchain technology and ICOs. Its findings will be presented to the federal government by the end of the year and will determine how the technology fits into existing Swiss laws and regulations.

"    When you were a young'un, your parents may have sat you down   to talk about the ""birds and the bees."" Now it's time to turn the   tables and address another uncomfortable topic: their   finances. Such conversations mark a reversal in the traditional   parent-child dynamic, and also can be fraught with concerns over   independence, trust and mortality. As a result, these talks often   don't happen at all, and a perceived lack of urgency is to blame,   according to a 2018 survey conducted by Wells Fargo. Roughly one-third of parents over the age of 60 say they've   never discussed later-life needs with family, including   inheritance plans, beneficiaries, important documents or   designated representatives, according to the survey. Meanwhile,   adult children worry such conversations will cause conflict or   make it seem as though they're after their parents' money.makeArticleAd(); As daunting as it may seem, it's important to have ""the talk""   about finances with your parents to help protect them from scams   and elder abuse, which cost Americans more than $36 billion each   year, according to financial services firm True Link Financial.   These conversations also ensure that a rapid-response plan is in   place in the event of disability and that there are no surprises   after your parents die, says Ron Long, head of regulatory affairs   and elder client initiatives at Wells Fargo Advisors. These four tips can open lines of communication. 1. Start with one conversation When's a good time to sit your parents down for a hard   conversation about their financial well-being, plans for the   future and important legal and financial documents like a will,   power of attorney or health care directives? The twelfth of   never, for most children. Don't wait for tragedy to strike. A study by Ameriprise   Financial found that a life-altering incident was the trigger for   90% of children who'd actually discussed estate planning with   their parents.  » Unfamiliar with estate planning?     See our   7-step checklist  Instead, carve out time for a family meeting - perhaps on   Mother's Day, Father's Day or the Friday after Thanksgiving -   when all the children are present, Long recommends. ""It's a good   way to get the conversation started and then you can do a   refresher or update down the road."" The first conversation should serve as a door-opener. There   are weighty decisions at play - which may change over time with   your parents' mental or physical health - so don't expect a   one-and-done conversation. 2.

"    When you were a young'un, your parents may have sat you down   to talk about the ""birds and the bees."" Now it's time to turn the   tables and address another uncomfortable topic: their   finances. Such conversations mark a reversal in the traditional   parent-child dynamic, and also can be fraught with concerns over   independence, trust and mortality. As a result, these talks often   don't happen at all, and a perceived lack of urgency is to blame,   according to a 2018 survey conducted by Wells Fargo. Roughly one-third of parents over the age of 60 say they've   never discussed later-life needs with family, including   inheritance plans, beneficiaries, important documents or   designated representatives, according to the survey. Meanwhile,   adult children worry such conversations will cause conflict or   make it seem as though they're after their parents' money.makeArticleAd(); As daunting as it may seem, it's important to have ""the talk""   about finances with your parents to help protect them from scams   and elder abuse, which cost Americans more than $36 billion each   year, according to financial services firm True Link Financial.   These conversations also ensure that a rapid-response plan is in   place in the event of disability and that there are no surprises   after your parents die, says Ron Long, head of regulatory affairs   and elder client initiatives at Wells Fargo Advisors. These four tips can open lines of communication. 1. Start with one conversation When's a good time to sit your parents down for a hard   conversation about their financial well-being, plans for the   future and important legal and financial documents like a will,   power of attorney or health care directives? The twelfth of   never, for most children. Don't wait for tragedy to strike. A study by Ameriprise   Financial found that a life-altering incident was the trigger for   90% of children who'd actually discussed estate planning with   their parents.  » Unfamiliar with estate planning?     See our   7-step checklist  Instead, carve out time for a family meeting - perhaps on   Mother's Day, Father's Day or the Friday after Thanksgiving -   when all the children are present, Long recommends. ""It's a good   way to get the conversation started and then you can do a   refresher or update down the road."" The first conversation should serve as a door-opener. There   are weighty decisions at play - which may change over time with   your parents' mental or physical health - so don't expect a   one-and-done conversation. 2. Begin with the basics Talking about money inspires reactions ranging from secretive   to forthright. Even if your parents aren't particularly prickly   about discussing their finances, it's prudent to ease into such   conversations.

"     Neogen Corporation NEOG  reported earnings of 33 cents per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. The figure considersadjustment for a 4-for-3 stock split effective Dec 29, 2017.The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 33.3% and increased 10% from the year-ago quarter's tally. Revenues increased 8.5% on a year-over-year basis to $109.3 million, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $108 million. For the full year, net income was $1.21 per share, 40.7% above the year-ago number. While the top line increased 11% annually to $402.3 million.   Neogen Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS     Surprise      Neogen Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS   Surprise    |      Neogen Corporation Quote  Per Neogen, revenues and net income for the fourth quarter and the full year established new all-time highs for the company.  Revenues in Detail    Food Safety Segment   : Revenues at the segment totaled $52.1 million, up 7.9% on solid overall organic growth in the reported quarter. Full-year revenues increased 14% to $196 million, partly aided by the acquisitions of Quat-Chem and Rogama. There was a 13% growth in sales of test kits to detect drug residues in milk, partially driven by new test kits to detect drug residues of special concern in Eastern Europe. The company witnessed 12% rise in sales of Neogen's rapid diagnostics to detect food allergens including gluten, milk, soy and peanuts in fiscal 2018. There was an 18% jump in sales of general sanitation products from the year-ago period. Sales of the foodborne pathogen detection tests increased 16% including a 27% improvement in the sale of tests to detect Listeria.   Animal Safety Segment   : The segment recorded revenues of $57.1 million, reflecting a 13.1% climb from the year-ago quarter's count. Fiscal 2018 revenues for this segment came in at $206.2 million, an 8.4% gain from the prior-year period's level. Full-year growth at the segment was mainly driven by a sales uptrend in the genomics business, an 11% rise in rodent control product line, 15% uptick in sales of animal care products along with a 13% raise in sales of drug detection products and a 23% hike in sales of detectable needles.  The worldwide genomics business unit recorded a 22% increase in fiscal 2018. Per management, this growth is attributable to the September 2017 buyout of the Neogen Australasia genomics laboratory in Australia. Also, the upside is backed by robust revenues grossed from the genomic testing of beef and dairy cattle, swine, poultry and companion animals at the other existing locations.  Margin Details  Gross margin contracted 219 basis points (bps) to 45.4% during the fourth quarter, largely riding on a 15.2% escalation in cost and an unfavorable product mix. Adjusted operating income was $19.9 million, accounting for 18.2% of sales in the fourth quarter compared with $19 million or 19.2% of sales a year ago, which implies a 105-bps contraction. Full-year gross margin was 47.3%, signifying a contraction of 30 basis points. According to Neogen, this was the impact of lower-margin revenues drawn from the consolidations of Quat-Chem and Rogama and the lower sales of higher-margin natural toxin kits, which partially offset the improved gross margins in the genomics business from lower raw material costs for both comparative periods.  Our Take  Neogen exited the fiscal 2018 on a solid note. We are encouraged by the year-over-year better-than-expected earnings and revenues. We believe that Neogen is steadily progressing on the back of its four-pronged strategy. Moreover, we are upbeat about the accretive integrations and an expanding international footprint, which should consistently drive results in the coming period.

"     Edwards Lifesciences Corporation EW  is slated to report second-quarter 2018 results,   after the market closes  on Jul 26. Last quarter, the company's earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.9%. Moreover, Edwards Lifesciences has delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 8.9%. Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.  Key Catalyst  Similar to the prior quarter, this time too, Edwards Lifesciences is expected to gain from strength in Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy segment (THVT). Banking on continued therapy adoption across all geographies with notable strength in the United States, the company is expected to maintain this bullish trend in the second quarter of 2018 as well. Of late, THVT has been on a strong growth trajectory in the United States. The company has been gaining from the receipt of FDA approval for aortic and mitral valve-in-valve procedures, using SAPIEN 3 transcatheter heart valve, which is expected to boost the top line at the THVT segment in the to-be-reported quarter as well. Edwards Lifesciences is expected to continue to gain from strong clinical performance by SAPIEN 3 in the United States as well as strong therapy implementation across all regions.  Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS   Surprise       Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS   Surprise    |      Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Quote  Outside the United States, the underlying growth rate was solid. The company has been fortifying its THVT business in Europe as well. In this regard, Edwards Lifesciences maintained double-digit procedure growth in Europe in the last reported quarter. Further, the company announced the receipt of CE Mark for its self-expanding CENTERA valve in February. The latest development is likely to enhance Edwards Lifesciences' prospects in Europe. The company also continued to see strong TAVR therapy adoption in Japan driven by SAPIEN 3. Moreover, some new centers were added in this highest growth region, which in turn is expected to result in increasing sales in the to-be-reported quarter. Accordingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for transcatheter heart valves (THV) sales of $586 million shows an increase of 20.1% from the year-ago quarter. Overall, second-quarter total revenues are projected at $964.7 million, up 14.6% from the prior-year quarter. Here are the other factors  that might influence Edwards Lifesciences' second-quarter results: Edwards Lifesciences is expected to maintain its strong performance based on strength in two other segments - Surgical Heart Valve Therapy and Critical Care. The Surgical Heart Valve Therapy product group delivered a strong performance last quarter driven by encouraging performance of new products along with strong uptake of aortic valves across all geographies. Moreover, buoyed by the continued adoption of INTUITY Elite valve system, management expects INTUITY Elite valve system sales to continue to drive the top line in the to-be-reported quarter. This apart, INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valve is witnessing encouraging demand in the United States since its roll out began last January. TheZacks Consensus Estimate for Surgical Heart Valve Therapy product sales of $217 million reflects a rise of 4.8% from the year-ago quarter. We are also upbeat about Critical Care product group sales witnessing solid growth across all product categories driven by strong performance in the company's core products, mainly in the United States and China. Also, Edwards Lifesciences aims to strengthen its hold in Critical Care technologies with the rollout of HemoSphere monitoring platform and expansion of Enhanced Surgical Recovery programs. The company also recently announced the approval of De Novo request by the FDA for the Acumen Hypotension Prediction Index (HPI) software. Notably, the company was planning a targeted launch of the product in the United States. Accordingly, theZacks Consensus Estimate for Critical Care product group sales of $161 million shows an increase of 9.5% from the year-ago quarter. For the second quarter of 2018, the company projects sales between $950 million and $1 billion and adjusted EPS between $1.05 and $1.15.

"   makeZacksArticleAd();Though Trump's protectionist stance and the resultant trade tension has been playing foul on the stock market, American stocks have been showing momentum lately with the S&P 500 index climbing to the highest level in more than five months. The impressive run has been credited to robust earnings and strengthening economy.   This is especially true as Q2 earnings from about 10% companies on the S&P 500 that have reported so far are up 23% on 10% higher revenues. The proportion of these companies beating EPS and revenue estimates is tracking above other recent periods. As a whole, earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to grow 20.4% from the same period last year on 8.3% higher revenues. This would be the third consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth, a trend that is currently expected to continue in the second half of the year. A strong economy and historic tax cuts will continue to drive earnings higher.   Additionally, the Fed Chairman's testimony, which reaffirmed the central bank's plans to gradually increase interest rates, added to the strength. Powell painted an optimistic view of the economy, citing that America is expanding at a faster pace. Robust job gains, rise in income and optimism among households have lifted consumer spending in recent months and will likely continue doing so. Unemployment rate is below 4% and inflation is running above the Fed's 2% target for the first time in several years.   All these developments are strong enough to justify continued interest rate increases. The Fed has raised rates twice this year in quarter-point increments and is expected to implement two more lift-offs by the end of this year.   While there are winners from various corners of the space, we have highlighted stocks that have shown strong momentum over the past five months and have a solid Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). Below we have presented a bunch of those that have easily led the way on the S&P 500 index in the past five months, gaining more than 45%, and will continue to outperform heading into the earnings season.

"Reuters  @media screen and (max-device-width: 480px){body{ font-size:30pt !important;}}    By Anna Irrera and Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi NEW YORK/ZURICH, July 19 (Reuters) - Swiss regulators are stepping up efforts to halt an exodus of cryptocurrency projects from the country, after two of only a handful of banks active in the nascent sector shut their doors on it in the last year. The departures, which industry sources fear will continue, mean Switzerland is losing business to offshore rivals including Liechtenstein, Gibraltar and the Cayman Islands, where banks are more welcoming.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','',''); The wealthy Swiss canton of Zug, for example, has been dubbed ""Crypto Valley"", with 200-300 virtual currency entities opening there in recent years. Zug's finance director, Heinz Taennler, says they may leave if the government does not take steps to give them access to the banking system, without which they struggle to function. ""All their banking relationships are going to Liechtenstein,"" he told Reuters. ""These are hundreds of jobs that have been created, and every job is important."" Thomas Moser, an alternate member of the governing board at the Swiss National Bank (SNB), said some cryptocurrency companies had asked the central to intervene. ""They raised concerns about problems with opening bank accounts, which was a worry for them, and asked for help,"" Moser told Reuters. ""I said this was not something the SNB dealt with, but they should speak with FINMA. FINMA, Switzerland's financial market supervisor, has held discussions with the SNB and bankers' association on how to make banks more accessible to cryptocurrency ventures. ""We would not want to close the door on the opportunities that such innovation (cryptocurrencies) might bring,"" Moser added. Providing the legal framework to launch ICOs and for banks to do business with cryptocurrency companies is not easy. The risk of fraud and lack of transparency about who owns cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether have made regulators around the world wary. The United States is among countries that are increasing scrutiny of the sector.   BANKS WARY Swiss banks are urging the authorities to give them more clarity on the rules that apply to cryptocurrency projects before providing services to the market, and at least two important players have withdrawn for now. Zuercher Kantonalbank (ZKB), the fourth largest Swiss bank and one of the few big banks in the world to welcome issuers of cryptocurrencies, has closed the accounts of more than 20 companies in the last year, industry sources told Reuters. A spokesman for ZKB declined to comment on any former or existing clients relationships, but said the bank does not do business with any cryptocurrency groups. Another large Swiss bank kicked out crypto project Smart Valor at around the same time, said a person familiar with the project. The source declined to name the bank. Only a handful of Switzerland's 250 banks ever allowed companies to deposit the cash equivalent of cryptocurrencies raised in ICOs. At least two still do, Reuters has established. But the involvement of a large bank like ZKB helped to establish Switzerland as an early cryptocurrency hub. ZKB and the bank that turned its back on Smart Valor began shutting their doors in October after a management feud severely damaged cryptocurrency project Tezos, which had conducted Zug's largest ICO, entrepreneurs and advisers said.  Swiss banks are worried because some companies that carried out ICOs did not do anti-money laundering (AML) checks on their contributors, industry sources said. This means the banks themselves could fall foul of AML rules.   LIECHTENSTEIN A WINNER ""A cautionary response from Swiss banks resulted in a pause or closure for most projects in the cryptocurrency space,""  said David Henderson, founder of the Swiss Sweetbridge Foundation, set up to conduct blockchain startup Sweetbridge's ICO. Sweetbridge was in the late stages of securing an account with ZKB, but the application was put on hold a few days after the Tezos scandal erupted, Henderson said. The project ultimately decided not to carry out its planned ICO through the Swiss foundation, setting up entities and bank accounts in Gibraltar and Liechtenstein instead. It is difficult for crypto-projects to use the funds they raise through ICOs if they are locked out of the banking system. Funds from ICOs are often originally raised in cryptocurrencies bitcoin and ether, which have limited use as a means of payment in the broader economy. ""I cannot pay salaries because our money is caught up there. We cannot move it,"" said the founder of a Swiss crypto-firm which has had accounts closed at three different banks. The banks have asked the firm to take out its money, but it is unable to do so without first finding another banking relationship, the founder added. At least two Swiss banks are still accepting ICO funds, according to checks by Reuters. These are Banca Zarattini, a small bank in the Italian-language canton Ticino, and Hypothekarbank Lenzburg, a regional lender located between Zurich and Basel, which recently began accepting crypto customers. Banca Zarattini only banks ICO companies with KYC (know-your-customer) and AML procedures that are in compliance with Swiss law, it said. Hypothekarbank Lenzburg said it had started to accept crytocurrency companies and could charge an initial assessment fee of up to 2,500 Swiss francs($2,500). Bank Frick in Liechtenstein has become a popular alternative for Swiss entities struggling to secure accounts. It banks around 160 crypto-enterprises or projects, of which 60 are in the process of setting up an ICO, the bank told Reuters. The bank, however, declined 90 percent of account requests from cryptocurrency companies and only accepts ICOs based onshore in Switzerland or Liechtenstein, it said.   RULES AND REASSURANCES Despite the challenges, Switzerland is working on new rules to reassure banks and encourage them to accept the accounts of cryptocurrency companies. The country has dropped from second place in 2017 to sixth this year in a country ranking of the sum of ICO funds raised,  according to a study published by PwC and the Crypto Valley Association in June. The Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands topped the list. In May, Swiss Finance Minister Ueli Maurer invited FINMA, the central bank and the Swiss Bankers Association (SBA) to a roundtable discussion on bank accounts for cryptocurrencies. After the meeting, the SBA set up a working group to compile a set of checks and conditions that all banks could follow when opening an account for cryptocurrency firms. ""Banks are currently hesitant to open business accounts for companies with particular touchpoints to ICOs and cryptocurrencies - due to risks such as fraud or money laundering,"" SBA said in a statement. Zug finance director Taennler said the aim set out during the meeting, which he attended, was to have a set of FINMA-approved guidelines for assessing prospective cryptocurrency clients by the year-end. FINMA has already issued separate guidelines to spell out how Swiss AML rules and securities regulations apply to various ICOs. But securities rules are less stringent in Switzerland than in the United States, where the Securities and Exchange Commission has toughened its stance on ICOs.  This makes it more risky for banks in Switzerland to be involved with ICO projects which may have raised money from U.S. contributors and could fall under the purview of the SEC. Switzerland's authorities have said they want to create conditions for the country to remain competitive but with no room for scams or financial crime. The finance ministry is also looking at the broader legal framework for blockchain technology and ICOs. Its findings will be presented to the federal government by the end of the year and will determine how the technology fits into existing Swiss laws and regulations.

Sweetbridge was in the late stages of securing an account with ZKB, but the application was put on hold a few days after the Tezos scandal erupted, Henderson said. The project ultimately decided not to carry out its planned ICO through the Swiss foundation, setting up entities and bank accounts in Gibraltar and Liechtenstein instead. It is difficult for crypto-projects to use the funds they raise through ICOs if they are locked out of the banking system. Funds from ICOs are often originally raised in cryptocurrencies bitcoin and ether, which have limited use as a means of payment in the broader economy. ""I cannot pay salaries because our money is caught up there. We cannot move it,"" said the founder of a Swiss crypto-firm which has had accounts closed at three different banks. The banks have asked the firm to take out its money, but it is unable to do so without first finding another banking relationship, the founder added. At least two Swiss banks are still accepting ICO funds, according to checks by Reuters. These are Banca Zarattini, a small bank in the Italian-language canton Ticino, and Hypothekarbank Lenzburg, a regional lender located between Zurich and Basel, which recently began accepting crypto customers. Banca Zarattini only banks ICO companies with KYC (know-your-customer) and AML procedures that are in compliance with Swiss law, it said. Hypothekarbank Lenzburg said it had started to accept crytocurrency companies and could charge an initial assessment fee of up to 2,500 Swiss francs($2,500). Bank Frick in Liechtenstein has become a popular alternative for Swiss entities struggling to secure accounts. It banks around 160 crypto-enterprises or projects, of which 60 are in the process of setting up an ICO, the bank told Reuters. The bank, however, declined 90 percent of account requests from cryptocurrency companies and only accepts ICOs based onshore in Switzerland or Liechtenstein, it said.   RULES AND REASSURANCES Despite the challenges, Switzerland is working on new rules to reassure banks and encourage them to accept the accounts of cryptocurrency companies. The country has dropped from second place in 2017 to sixth this year in a country ranking of the sum of ICO funds raised,  according to a study published by PwC and the Crypto Valley Association in June. The Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands topped the list. In May, Swiss Finance Minister Ueli Maurer invited FINMA, the central bank and the Swiss Bankers Association (SBA) to a roundtable discussion on bank accounts for cryptocurrencies. After the meeting, the SBA set up a working group to compile a set of checks and conditions that all banks could follow when opening an account for cryptocurrency firms. ""Banks are currently hesitant to open business accounts for companies with particular touchpoints to ICOs and cryptocurrencies - due to risks such as fraud or money laundering,"" SBA said in a statement. Zug finance director Taennler said the aim set out during the meeting, which he attended, was to have a set of FINMA-approved guidelines for assessing prospective cryptocurrency clients by the year-end. FINMA has already issued separate guidelines to spell out how Swiss AML rules and securities regulations apply to various ICOs. But securities rules are less stringent in Switzerland than in the United States, where the Securities and Exchange Commission has toughened its stance on ICOs.  This makes it more risky for banks in Switzerland to be involved with ICO projects which may have raised money from U.S. contributors and could fall under the purview of the SEC. Switzerland's authorities have said they want to create conditions for the country to remain competitive but with no room for scams or financial crime. The finance ministry is also looking at the broader legal framework for blockchain technology and ICOs. Its findings will be presented to the federal government by the end of the year and will determine how the technology fits into existing Swiss laws and regulations.

"    When you were a young'un, your parents may have sat you down   to talk about the ""birds and the bees."" Now it's time to turn the   tables and address another uncomfortable topic: their   finances. Such conversations mark a reversal in the traditional   parent-child dynamic, and also can be fraught with concerns over   independence, trust and mortality. As a result, these talks often   don't happen at all, and a perceived lack of urgency is to blame,   according to a 2018 survey conducted by Wells Fargo. Roughly one-third of parents over the age of 60 say they've   never discussed later-life needs with family, including   inheritance plans, beneficiaries, important documents or   designated representatives, according to the survey. Meanwhile,   adult children worry such conversations will cause conflict or   make it seem as though they're after their parents' money.makeArticleAd(); As daunting as it may seem, it's important to have ""the talk""   about finances with your parents to help protect them from scams   and elder abuse, which cost Americans more than $36 billion each   year, according to financial services firm True Link Financial.   These conversations also ensure that a rapid-response plan is in   place in the event of disability and that there are no surprises   after your parents die, says Ron Long, head of regulatory affairs   and elder client initiatives at Wells Fargo Advisors. These four tips can open lines of communication. 1. Start with one conversation When's a good time to sit your parents down for a hard   conversation about their financial well-being, plans for the   future and important legal and financial documents like a will,   power of attorney or health care directives? The twelfth of   never, for most children. Don't wait for tragedy to strike. A study by Ameriprise   Financial found that a life-altering incident was the trigger for   90% of children who'd actually discussed estate planning with   their parents.  » Unfamiliar with estate planning?     See our   7-step checklist  Instead, carve out time for a family meeting - perhaps on   Mother's Day, Father's Day or the Friday after Thanksgiving -   when all the children are present, Long recommends. ""It's a good   way to get the conversation started and then you can do a   refresher or update down the road."" The first conversation should serve as a door-opener. There   are weighty decisions at play - which may change over time with   your parents' mental or physical health - so don't expect a   one-and-done conversation. 2. Begin with the basics Talking about money inspires reactions ranging from secretive   to forthright. Even if your parents aren't particularly prickly   about discussing their finances, it's prudent to ease into such   conversations. Long says a strategy that's ""very helpful"" is approaching   discussions from a group-planning perspective - sharing what   end-of-life goals you're considering and asking your parents   about theirs. ""Remember, these are subjects that a lot of older   folks hold close to their hearts,"" he says. Be sensitive when starting that initial conversation. Think   less interrogative (how much money's at stake and who gets what?)   and more collaborative (exchanging information about where   accounts are held or who has power of attorney). 3. Broach serious topics Once you've established a rapport, tackle topics that make   either you or your parents uncomfortable, including the morose   (funeral arrangements or declining health) and the dangerous   (financial scams targeting seniors that could wipe out their   savings). Don't let the prospect of an awkward conversation now create a   bigger headache in the future. Strive for this balance:   confronting reality head-on without infantilizing or offending   your parents. A bad way to deal? Shutting down future   conversations when talks are strained. A better way to deal?   Involving other family members to facilitate discussion or   working with a financial advisor to handle trickier topics.

"  @media screen and (max-device-width: 480px){body{ font-size:30pt !important;}}    By Jessica DiNapoli July 13 (Reuters) - Bankrupt fashion company Nine West Holdings Inc has asked investment bank Lazard Ltd  to help it explore a sale, people familiar with the matter said on Friday, a month after its namesake brand known for its footwear and handbags fetched $340 million in an auction. The sale of the Nine West brand, for $140 million more than the first offer, has emboldened the company to seek an outright sale for its remaining assets which include its jeanswear and jewelry businesses, and the Anne Klein and Kasper women's' brands, the sources said. Some creditors had planned to convert their debt to equityin the remaining business.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','',''); The sources cautioned that no deal is certain and asked not to be named because the deliberations are confidential. Nine West and Sycamore Partners, the buyout firm that owns the company, declined to comment. Lazard did not immediately return a request for comment. Many of the U.S. retailers that sell Nine West merchandise, such as department store operator Bon-Ton Stores Inc, have filed for bankruptcy or faced financial distress as online shopping has decimated foot traffic in their stores. Nine West filed for bankruptcy in April after failing to meet its debt obligations in March. Nine West's jeanswear and jewelry businesses, together with Anne Klein and Kasper, had net revenues of $1.1 billion in 2017, according to bankruptcy court documents. The jeanswear line includes Gloria Vanderbilt jeans sold in Costco Wholesale Corp, Kohls Corp  and Sears Holdings Corp. Anne Klein and Kasper, sold at department stores such as Macy's Inc, are widely considered storied names in fashion that set the tone for women's careerwear. Brand licensor Authentic Brands Group LLC completed the acquisition of the Nine West brand this month after beating shoe retailer DSW Inc  in an auction.  A group of creditors in Nine West has been looking into potential legal claims against Sycamore Partners, seeking greater recovery on their investment, according to court papers. The creditors have claimed in court documents that Sycamore may have acquired some of Nine West's assets, such as the high-end Kurt Geiger and Stuart Weitzman shoe businesses, for less than their true value, according to the papers.

"   makeZacksArticleAd();Come Jul 16 and Amazon.com, Inc.'s AMZN Prime Day begins. Naturally, much like millions of shoppers, the e-commerce giant too will be waiting with bated breath for the shopping extravaganza to start. After all, Prime Day means a lot to Amazon. However, it's not only Amazon that makes a lot from Prime Day. Amazon in a way is also helping its rivals like Walmart Inc. WMT , Target Corporation TGT , eBay, Inc. EBAY and Macy's, Inc. M to cash in on this opportunity.From brick-and-mortar stores to e-commerce companies, Amazon's rivals are trying to make the most of Prime Day with a host of offers. Amazon, which has changed the entire retail landscape in the last few years, is once again proving to be a big influencer in driving retail sales.Amazon Shows the WayLaunched in 2015, Prime Day has proved to be Amazon's biggest money churning machine. And the e-commerce giant isn't leaving any stone unturned to reach out to more shoppers this time too. In doing so, it has extended Prime Day to a 36-hour online deal, including offers at Whole Foods, expansion to four new countries and surprise events in five cities.Understandably, extending Prime Day by six hours is in a move to attract more customers. This certainly will boost Amazon's sales, as Prime members will have the option to choose form as much as one million items this time.The company expects Prime Day to generate $3.4 billion in sales worldwide compared with $2.4 billion in 2017. In fact, so successful was Prime Day last year that it even outpaced Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Amazon has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .Amazon had started Prime Day as a bulk clearance sale but its success turned it into a global shopping event. This certainly has changed the way people have so long shopped. Today, shoppers eagerly wait for Prime Day.Prime Day Helps Amazon's RivalsAmazon has changed the entire retail ballgame in the last few years. This has made its rivals change focus toward online retail. Prime Day, on the other hand, has emerged as one of the most attractive shopping extravaganzas in its event calendar. However, in turning Prime Day into a mega shopping affair, Amazon in a way is helping its rivals.From brick-and-mortar giants to e-commerce companies, today everyone is offering discounts around Prime Day. One of the major beneficiaries is Amazon's closest rival Walmart, which is offering its new customers a discount of $10 on about three different orders using the code, ""WALMART3"" on pickups of $50 or higher till Jul 31. Moreover, Walmart will also be giving 3% cash back to credit card holders for any grocery pickup service from its stores.Also, Target has entered into a partnership with membership-based grocery service provider, Shipt, for same-day delivery. Similarly, eBay too will be coming up with a wide range of deals starting Jul 16.It goes without saying that Amazon's rivals are fast trying to catch up. Prime Day has certainly proved to be one of the biggest events for Amazon. So has it for the likes of Walmart, Target and eBay, which are trying to lure more customers with similar deals and discounts. Moreover, Amazon's competitors also have a certain advantage, as Prime Day can be enjoyed only by Prime members, while most of its rivals are keeping their offers open to everyone.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>   Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

"   InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI've been a huge bull on beaten-up retail stocks over the past year. The narrative has sharply reversed course from Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) killing all of retail to traditional retailers fighting back by remodeling their stores, building out omni-channel sales capability, incorporating more loyalty perks, and discounting prices to reasonable-yet-attractive levels.makeArticleAd();The net result has been largely improved results across all of retail. A few years back, every retailer was reporting negative comparable sales growth and margin compression. Now, the norm in retail is positive comparable sales growth, driven by robust digital sales growth, and margin expansion off recent lows.In response, retail stocks are in rally mode. Names such as Macy's (NYSE: M ), Kohl's (NYSE: KSS ), Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ: URBN ) and Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE: ANF ) are all up more than 60% over the past year.18 Stocks That Could Be Takeover TargetsBut one retailer that has missed out on this rally is Nordstrom (NYSE: JWN ). Over the past year, JWN stock is up just 6%.Why has JWN stock sat out this big retail rally? Mostly valuation concerns. Those valuation concerns reared their ugly head recently. Management gave a solid long-term update on sales and earnings growth outlook at the company's Investor Day. But, JWN stock dropped sharply in response.While this recent dip may present a buying opportunity, I really don't think JWN stock is worth much more than $55 today.Here's a deeper look.Why Nordstrom Stock Has Missed the Retail RallyEverything in retail is improving right now.Nordstrom is no exception to that broad trend. Comparable sales growth has inflected into positive territory, and the trend is presently upward. The worst of margin compression from sales deleverage and discounting appears to be in the rear-view mirror. The digital and off-price businesses appear to be doing really well. The outlook for long-term sales and earnings growth is improving, and management is guiding for 3-4% sales growth and 5-6% EBIT growth over the next five years.Overall, the numbers are improving at Nordstrom, just like they are improving elsewhere in retail. But JWN stock isn't rallying like other retail stocks.Why? Valuation.Other retail stocks were priced for death a year ago. Macy's stock was trading at around 7-times forward earnings. Kohl's stock was trading just under 10-times forward earnings, and Urban Outfitters stock was trading just over 10-times forward earnings.Thus, when the numbers got better at Macy's, Kohl's and Urban Outfitters, those stocks took off like rocket ships.But a year ago, JWN stock was trading at 16-times forward earnings. That isn't a death multiple. It is actually a market-average multiple, so JWN stock was already priced for operational improvement. Thus, as the numbers have improved over the past several quarters, JWN stock hasn't gone anywhere.Nordstrom Stock Isn't Worth Much More Than $55Today, JWN stock trades at just under 15-times forward earnings. That isn't that cheap. But it also isn't that expensive, and the fundamentals are improving.Sales growth is now consistently back in the picture at JWN. Management is targeting 3-4% sales growth per year over the next several years. I think that is very doable, considering the long-term average sales growth rate at JWN is around 5%.Management is also targeting EBIT growth of 5-6% per year over the next several years. That implies EBIT margins to rise to about 6.5% in five years. That also seems doable. EBIT margins were 11.1% five years ago, but have since tumbled to 6.1%. There are signs that EBIT margins are normalizing, and as such, a conservative rebound to 6.5% over the next five years seems likely.Under the assumption that sales growth runs around 3-4% per year and EBIT margins rebound towards 6.5%, I think Nordstrom can net around $4.80 in earnings per share in five years. A market-average 16 forward multiple on that implies a four-year forward price target of about $77. Discounted back by 10% per year, that equates to a present-day value in the lower-$50s.20 Massively Underpriced Stocks Wall Street Expects to SoarBottom Line on JWN StockRetail stocks are in rally mode. But JWN stock has missed the rally because of a stretched valuation. Unfortunately, the valuation remains big today. Granted, the numbers are improving, but such improvements will lead to mitigated stock price appreciation - thanks to the already big valuation.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long M, KSS, and ANF.More From InvestorPlace20 Red-Hot Tech Stocks to ConsiderThe ABSOLUTE Best Way to Invest in the Marijuana BoomThe Best Shot You'll Ever Have at Making 50 TIMES Your Money4 Developments That Will Fuel the Mega Marijuana MarketCompare BrokersThe post Here's Why Nordstrom Stock Has Missed Out on the Retail Rally appeared first on InvestorPlace .

"We're just over halfway through 2018, so it's a good time to   take a step back and look at how investments have performed so   far this year. As far as high-   dividend   stocks    go, many have been under significant pressure thanks to rising   interest rates. In fact, high-dividend stocks have underperformed   the   S&P 500    by more than 4 percentage points, as a group. With that in mind, here are the five best-performing   high-dividend stocks (defined as yields of 3% or more) on the   S&P 500 through the first six months of 2018, followed by a   brief discussion of why they've done so well.   Image Source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();      Company (Symbol)     Recent Stock Price     Dividend Yield     Year-to-Date Total Return         Macy's            (NYSE: M)   $36.52   4.1%   48.5%      Seagate Technology            (NASDAQ: STX)   $58.33   4.3%   42.6%      ONEOK            (NYSE: OKE)   $71.34   4.5%   37.1%      Kohl's            (NYSE: KSS)   $70.78   3.4%   33.1%      First Energy            (NYSE: FE)   $36.27   3.9%   21.2%     Data source:       TD Ameritrade    . Prices, yields, and total returns as of July 9, 2018. For some retailers, things aren't as bad as they may have   looked Many retail stocks had been beaten down tremendously in 2017,   as investors worried about the ""retail apocalypse."" While this   certainly made sense given the wave of high-profile retail   bankruptcies of recent years, it appears that the fears were   overblown for certain retailers. You can see two good examples of this in the chart: Macy's and   Kohls. Both are among the S&P 500's top performers so far in   2018, and have returned 68% and 93%, respectively, over the past   year.       M Total Return Price    data by   YCharts    . Kohl's has produced some impressive returns recently. As my   colleague Adam Levine-Weinberg pointed out in a   recent episode    of the   Industry Focus    podcast, it was Kohl's 6.3% comparable sales increase during the   fourth quarter that was really the key to the stock's rally, and   sales figures have continued to look impressive since then.   Macy's has also seen comps grow, with a 4.2% increase in the   first quarter. Simply put, it looks like some of these retailers' turnaround   initiatives have been working, such as Macy's expanded loyalty   program. And there could be more growth ahead with the company's   omnichannel efforts to grow in-store pickup and ship-to-store   sales. Not to be outdone, Kohl's is developing an ""if you can't   beat 'em, join 'em"" attitude when it comes to   Amazon.com    (NASDAQ: AMZN) , and is testing a partnership with the e-commerce   giant to accept Amazon returns in certain Kohl's locations, with   the goal of creating more foot traffic in their stores. The hard-drive business is doing well Seagate is another company that has performed incredibly well   this year, as demand for storage seems to be trending upward. In   the most recent quarter, Seagate shipped 87.4 exabytes of   hard-drive capacity, a 33% increase over the previous year. A big driver of this is increased enterprise business --   specifically, the growth of data centers in recent years.   Enterprise customers now make up 44% of Seagate's revenue, up by   700 basis points over the past two years. And as I've written   before in reference to   data center real estate investment trust Digital Realty    (NYSE: DLR) , the need for data storage doesn't appear to be   slowing down anytime soon. One of the top-performing energy stocks ONEOK is a midstream energy company -- which essentially means   that they transport energy products, particularly natural gas.   ONEOK has one of the largest natural gas pipeline systems in the   U.S. and is investing considerable money in planned   expansion projects    , with about $4 billion of growth projects announced over the   past year or so. Not only is ONEOK one of the highest-dividend companies in the   S&P 500, but the company has an ambitious goal of increasing   its dividend at a 9% to 11% pace over the next several years,   fueled by the aforementioned expansion projects. A utility in the top performers? It may seem odd to see a utility stock like Ohio-based   FirstEnergy in the list of highest-performing stocks, since not   only are utilities generally considered low-volatility safe   stocks but because many high-dividend utilities have been under   pressure as interest rates have risen. However, FirstEnergy's recent results were enough to cause the   stock's impressive rally. The company's revenue has increased   during the past two quarters, reversing a nearly two-year   decline, and earnings soared. Also, FirstEnergy's profit margin   was the highest it's been in nine years.   10 stocks we like better than Macy's       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

"Reuters  @media screen and (max-device-width: 480px){body{ font-size:30pt !important;}}    By Anna Irrera and Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi NEW YORK/ZURICH, July 19 (Reuters) - Swiss regulators are stepping up efforts to halt an exodus of cryptocurrency projects from the country, after two of only a handful of banks active in the nascent sector shut their doors on it in the last year. The departures, which industry sources fear will continue, mean Switzerland is losing business to offshore rivals including Liechtenstein, Gibraltar and the Cayman Islands, where banks are more welcoming.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','',''); The wealthy Swiss canton of Zug, for example, has been dubbed ""Crypto Valley"", with 200-300 virtual currency entities opening there in recent years. Zug's finance director, Heinz Taennler, says they may leave if the government does not take steps to give them access to the banking system, without which they struggle to function. ""All their banking relationships are going to Liechtenstein,"" he told Reuters. ""These are hundreds of jobs that have been created, and every job is important."" Thomas Moser, an alternate member of the governing board at the Swiss National Bank (SNB), said some cryptocurrency companies had asked the central to intervene. ""They raised concerns about problems with opening bank accounts, which was a worry for them, and asked for help,"" Moser told Reuters. ""I said this was not something the SNB dealt with, but they should speak with FINMA. FINMA, Switzerland's financial market supervisor, has held discussions with the SNB and bankers' association on how to make banks more accessible to cryptocurrency ventures. ""We would not want to close the door on the opportunities that such innovation (cryptocurrencies) might bring,"" Moser added. Providing the legal framework to launch ICOs and for banks to do business with cryptocurrency companies is not easy. The risk of fraud and lack of transparency about who owns cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether have made regulators around the world wary. The United States is among countries that are increasing scrutiny of the sector.   BANKS WARY Swiss banks are urging the authorities to give them more clarity on the rules that apply to cryptocurrency projects before providing services to the market, and at least two important players have withdrawn for now. Zuercher Kantonalbank (ZKB), the fourth largest Swiss bank and one of the few big banks in the world to welcome issuers of cryptocurrencies, has closed the accounts of more than 20 companies in the last year, industry sources told Reuters. A spokesman for ZKB declined to comment on any former or existing clients relationships, but said the bank does not do business with any cryptocurrency groups. Another large Swiss bank kicked out crypto project Smart Valor at around the same time, said a person familiar with the project. The source declined to name the bank. Only a handful of Switzerland's 250 banks ever allowed companies to deposit the cash equivalent of cryptocurrencies raised in ICOs. At least two still do, Reuters has established. But the involvement of a large bank like ZKB helped to establish Switzerland as an early cryptocurrency hub. ZKB and the bank that turned its back on Smart Valor began shutting their doors in October after a management feud severely damaged cryptocurrency project Tezos, which had conducted Zug's largest ICO, entrepreneurs and advisers said.  Swiss banks are worried because some companies that carried out ICOs did not do anti-money laundering (AML) checks on their contributors, industry sources said. This means the banks themselves could fall foul of AML rules.   LIECHTENSTEIN A WINNER ""A cautionary response from Swiss banks resulted in a pause or closure for most projects in the cryptocurrency space,""  said David Henderson, founder of the Swiss Sweetbridge Foundation, set up to conduct blockchain startup Sweetbridge's ICO. Sweetbridge was in the late stages of securing an account with ZKB, but the application was put on hold a few days after the Tezos scandal erupted, Henderson said. The project ultimately decided not to carry out its planned ICO through the Swiss foundation, setting up entities and bank accounts in Gibraltar and Liechtenstein instead. It is difficult for crypto-projects to use the funds they raise through ICOs if they are locked out of the banking system. Funds from ICOs are often originally raised in cryptocurrencies bitcoin and ether, which have limited use as a means of payment in the broader economy. ""I cannot pay salaries because our money is caught up there. We cannot move it,"" said the founder of a Swiss crypto-firm which has had accounts closed at three different banks. The banks have asked the firm to take out its money, but it is unable to do so without first finding another banking relationship, the founder added. At least two Swiss banks are still accepting ICO funds, according to checks by Reuters. These are Banca Zarattini, a small bank in the Italian-language canton Ticino, and Hypothekarbank Lenzburg, a regional lender located between Zurich and Basel, which recently began accepting crypto customers. Banca Zarattini only banks ICO companies with KYC (know-your-customer) and AML procedures that are in compliance with Swiss law, it said. Hypothekarbank Lenzburg said it had started to accept crytocurrency companies and could charge an initial assessment fee of up to 2,500 Swiss francs($2,500). Bank Frick in Liechtenstein has become a popular alternative for Swiss entities struggling to secure accounts. It banks around 160 crypto-enterprises or projects, of which 60 are in the process of setting up an ICO, the bank told Reuters. The bank, however, declined 90 percent of account requests from cryptocurrency companies and only accepts ICOs based onshore in Switzerland or Liechtenstein, it said.   RULES AND REASSURANCES Despite the challenges, Switzerland is working on new rules to reassure banks and encourage them to accept the accounts of cryptocurrency companies. The country has dropped from second place in 2017 to sixth this year in a country ranking of the sum of ICO funds raised,  according to a study published by PwC and the Crypto Valley Association in June. The Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands topped the list. In May, Swiss Finance Minister Ueli Maurer invited FINMA, the central bank and the Swiss Bankers Association (SBA) to a roundtable discussion on bank accounts for cryptocurrencies. After the meeting, the SBA set up a working group to compile a set of checks and conditions that all banks could follow when opening an account for cryptocurrency firms. ""Banks are currently hesitant to open business accounts for companies with particular touchpoints to ICOs and cryptocurrencies - due to risks such as fraud or money laundering,"" SBA said in a statement. Zug finance director Taennler said the aim set out during the meeting, which he attended, was to have a set of FINMA-approved guidelines for assessing prospective cryptocurrency clients by the year-end. FINMA has already issued separate guidelines to spell out how Swiss AML rules and securities regulations apply to various ICOs. But securities rules are less stringent in Switzerland than in the United States, where the Securities and Exchange Commission has toughened its stance on ICOs.  This makes it more risky for banks in Switzerland to be involved with ICO projects which may have raised money from U.S. contributors and could fall under the purview of the SEC. Switzerland's authorities have said they want to create conditions for the country to remain competitive but with no room for scams or financial crime. The finance ministry is also looking at the broader legal framework for blockchain technology and ICOs. Its findings will be presented to the federal government by the end of the year and will determine how the technology fits into existing Swiss laws and regulations.

"    When you were a young'un, your parents may have sat you down   to talk about the ""birds and the bees."" Now it's time to turn the   tables and address another uncomfortable topic: their   finances. Such conversations mark a reversal in the traditional   parent-child dynamic, and also can be fraught with concerns over   independence, trust and mortality. As a result, these talks often   don't happen at all, and a perceived lack of urgency is to blame,   according to a 2018 survey conducted by Wells Fargo. Roughly one-third of parents over the age of 60 say they've   never discussed later-life needs with family, including   inheritance plans, beneficiaries, important documents or   designated representatives, according to the survey. Meanwhile,   adult children worry such conversations will cause conflict or   make it seem as though they're after their parents' money.makeArticleAd(); As daunting as it may seem, it's important to have ""the talk""   about finances with your parents to help protect them from scams   and elder abuse, which cost Americans more than $36 billion each   year, according to financial services firm True Link Financial.   These conversations also ensure that a rapid-response plan is in   place in the event of disability and that there are no surprises   after your parents die, says Ron Long, head of regulatory affairs   and elder client initiatives at Wells Fargo Advisors. These four tips can open lines of communication. 1. Start with one conversation When's a good time to sit your parents down for a hard   conversation about their financial well-being, plans for the   future and important legal and financial documents like a will,   power of attorney or health care directives?

"    When you were a young'un, your parents may have sat you down   to talk about the ""birds and the bees."" Now it's time to turn the   tables and address another uncomfortable topic: their   finances. Such conversations mark a reversal in the traditional   parent-child dynamic, and also can be fraught with concerns over   independence, trust and mortality. As a result, these talks often   don't happen at all, and a perceived lack of urgency is to blame,   according to a 2018 survey conducted by Wells Fargo. Roughly one-third of parents over the age of 60 say they've   never discussed later-life needs with family, including   inheritance plans, beneficiaries, important documents or   designated representatives, according to the survey. Meanwhile,   adult children worry such conversations will cause conflict or   make it seem as though they're after their parents' money.makeArticleAd(); As daunting as it may seem, it's important to have ""the talk""   about finances with your parents to help protect them from scams   and elder abuse, which cost Americans more than $36 billion each   year, according to financial services firm True Link Financial.   These conversations also ensure that a rapid-response plan is in   place in the event of disability and that there are no surprises   after your parents die, says Ron Long, head of regulatory affairs   and elder client initiatives at Wells Fargo Advisors. These four tips can open lines of communication. 1.

"   makeZacksArticleAd();Though Trump's protectionist stance and the resultant trade tension has been playing foul on the stock market, American stocks have been showing momentum lately with the S&P 500 index climbing to the highest level in more than five months. The impressive run has been credited to robust earnings and strengthening economy.   This is especially true as Q2 earnings from about 10% companies on the S&P 500 that have reported so far are up 23% on 10% higher revenues. The proportion of these companies beating EPS and revenue estimates is tracking above other recent periods. As a whole, earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to grow 20.4% from the same period last year on 8.3% higher revenues. This would be the third consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth, a trend that is currently expected to continue in the second half of the year. A strong economy and historic tax cuts will continue to drive earnings higher.   Additionally, the Fed Chairman's testimony, which reaffirmed the central bank's plans to gradually increase interest rates, added to the strength. Powell painted an optimistic view of the economy, citing that America is expanding at a faster pace. Robust job gains, rise in income and optimism among households have lifted consumer spending in recent months and will likely continue doing so. Unemployment rate is below 4% and inflation is running above the Fed's 2% target for the first time in several years.   All these developments are strong enough to justify continued interest rate increases. The Fed has raised rates twice this year in quarter-point increments and is expected to implement two more lift-offs by the end of this year.   While there are winners from various corners of the space, we have highlighted stocks that have shown strong momentum over the past five months and have a solid Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

"Chipotle Mexican Grill    's (NYSE: CMG) new CEO Brian Niccol has some grand plans. In   announcing his turnaround plan for the fast-casual restaurant   chain last month, he said he ""can easily see a future where   Chipotle more than doubles the business to $10 billion in   revenue."" Yet in the conference call that followed, executives failed to   flesh out the details of how they planned to achieve their   ambitious goals. And Niccol offered no timetable for when he   expected Chipotle to be able to more than double its   revenue. Having goals is good, but you generally only reach them if you   have a roadmap to follow.makeArticleAd();   Image source: Chipotle Mexican Grill. Analysts chastised the company for its lack of specificity.   Guggenheim's Matthew DiFrisco, for example,   wrote in a note to clients    that the call ""lacked meaningful near-term catalysts or fine   tuned financial objectives."" The former Taco Bell executive is most known for his success   in turning that chain into a social media brand via effective   marketing to younger consumers, and it's likely that he'll   replicate much of that strategy at Chipotle. A new plan of attack Chipotle Mexican Grill is still trying to recover from the   2015-2016 E. coli contamination scandal that drove customers away   and sent revenue tumbling by 13% in 2016. Although sales   rebounded somewhat in 2017, a lot of work remains to be done. In a press release that broadly described the changes he wants   to make in its corporate culture, Niccol said that Chipotle   will:  Become more culturally relevant and engaging; Digitize and modernize its restaurants; Improve hospitality; Enhance its ""powerful economic model"" by being disciplined     and focused; and Build a support structure for the innovation to come across     the company.  By doing these things, Niccol hopes to put Chipotle back on   its former growth trajectory. Yet that might not be feasible: at   least not in a reasonable amount of time.       Chipotle Mexican Grill Revenue (TTM)    , data by   YCharts    . TTM=trailing twelve months. No longer a growth stock Chipotle Mexican Grill has a history of strong growth, having   doubled its revenue every few years before the foodborne-illness   crisis hit the chain. But it was also a much smaller, more nimble   company that was leading the crest of a fast-casual restaurant   wave that has long since matured. At the time, it was one of a relatively small number of   national Tex-Mex chains. There has since been an explosion of   them, including Moe's Southwest Grill, Baja Fresh, and Qdoba,   which itself has been struggling. But increasing competition isn't the only reason why it may be   many years before Chipotle's annual revenue hits $10 billion. When Chipotle doubled revenue between 2007 and 2011, the   number of restaurants it operated grew from 704 to 1,230: a 75%   increase. When revenue doubled again by 2015, the chain had grown   by another 63% to 2,010 locations. Today, Chipotle has more than 2,400 restaurants -- a 21%   increase from two years ago -- but the company is now intent on   closing underperforming stores. That's a smart strategy, but one   that will slow its expansion rate. More pain on the menu Between the store closures, the moves to restructure the   business, and the   relocation of its corporate headquarters    from Denver to Newport Beach, California, Chipotle expects to   take as much as $135 million in charges over the next few   quarters. While store openings fueled a lot of the chain's early growth,   repeat business is vital, too, and Chipotle is still having   trouble attracting customers. Although it has reported comparable   restaurant sales growth in recent quarters, the increases were   driven by higher average checks, not more traffic. It's not certain that what worked for Niccol at Taco Bell -- a   fast-food purveyor that tends to take an irreverent tone about   its menu -- will work at a chain whose customers are noted for   their seriousness about conscious eating and healthfulness. ""Yo   quiero Chipotle Mexican Grill"" from a talking chihuahua might not   generate the same resonance. With the fast-casual trend waning, restaurant dining habits   changing, and direct competition rising, its unreasonable to   expect revenue to double at Chipotle any time soon. It's good   that Niccol has a positive outlook for his company -- what else   should a new CEO have? -- but investors shouldn't put much stock   in such claims. Currently, the restaurant chain's shares are trading at levels   typically reserved for businesses on top of their game, not ones   searching for a path out of the morass.

"     Domino's Pizza, Inc. DPZ  is scheduled to report second-quarter 2018 earnings on Jul 19, 2018, before the market opens. In the last reported quarter, the company's earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13%.  Q2 Expectations  The question lingering in investors' minds now is whether Domino's will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.76, higher than $1.32 reported in the year-ago quarter. Of late, the company's earnings estimates have witnessed upward revisions. In first-quarter 2018, it witnessed earnings growth of 58.7% on a year-over-year basis. Meanwhile, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of nearly $783.6 million, up 24.7% from the prior-year quarter. Let's delve deeper to find out how the company's top and bottom line will shape up this earnings season.  Factors at Play  Domino's top line in the second-quarter 2018 will continue to be driven by solid brand positioning. Also, the company's efforts to fortify its presence in the high-growth international markets bode well. Meanwhile, Domino's international growth continues to be strong and diversified across markets, courtesy of exceptional unit level economics. Notably, the first quarter of 2018 marked the 97th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales in its international business. Additionally, the company's all four geographic regions reported positive comps, with Americas and Asia-Pacific gaining the most. Moving ahead, Domino's initiatives on the digital front, increased store counts, focus on re-imaging and other sales-boosting strategies are expected to help sustain the momentum. Furthermore, its digital loyalty program - Piece of the Pie Rewards - continues to contribute significantly toward increase in traffic. The company's extended ways to order a pizza has kept it in the forefront of digital ordering and customer convenience. Domino's also has a wide franchise network, both domestically and internationally. Impressively, by reducing its ownership of restaurants and focusing more on re-franchising, the company minimizes capital requirements and facilitates earnings per share growth and ROE expansion.

Our proven model does not show that Domino's is likely to beat earnings estimates in second-quarter 2018. This is because a stock needs to have both - a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) - for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter  . Domino's has an Earnings ESP of -0.97%. Although, the company's Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.  You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here  .   Stocks With Favorable Combination  Here are a few other stocks from the Restaurant  space that investors may consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the second quarter: Brinker International, Inc. EAT  has an Earnings ESP of +0.78% and a Zacks Rank #2. The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated CAKE  has an Earnings ESP of +0.50% and a Zacks Rank of 3. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. CMG  has an Earnings ESP of +0.85% and a Zacks Rank #3.  The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All  Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce """"the world's first trillionaires,"""" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.

"Chipotle    (NYSE: CMG) has been on a tear in 2018, surging over 40% since   the start of the year. Of course, the stock had already been down   so much, so when new CEO Brian Niccol replaced founder Steve Ells   in February, the market took a fresh look at the company, sending   the stock up from around $300 per share to over $450 today. Except for one thing:   Nothing's really changed    in Chipotle's operating results. At least, not yet. Acknowledging   this, Niccol recently unveiled a new plan to get Chipotle back on   track. The effect? An 8% drop in the stock the next day.makeArticleAd(); Though shares have managed to recover, I think the market may   be catching on to the fact that the new plan is really more of   the same stuff Ells was trying, just implemented by a new person   at the top.   Image source: Chipotle. Calling Don Draper At Taco Bell, Niccol was known for his savvy and playful   marketing, and investors hope he can leverage these skills to   improve Chipotle's marketing efficacy. Chief Marketing Officer   Chris Brandt, who joined in March, outlined management's ""new""   strategy:  Our ultimate marketing mission is to make Chipotle not just     a food brand, but a purpose-driven lifestyle brand. ... We need     to show people we can have some fun, because when a brand has a     purpose, is visible and is doing fun things that are a part of     culture, people are more interested in it and want to be a part     of it.  I hate to break it to Niccol and Brandt, but Chipotle had   already been striving to be a lifestyle brand that engaged in   fun, innovative marketing for many years. The company won Best TV   ad award at Cannes in 2012 for its Willie Nelson-sung animated   piece ""   Back to the Start    "" that aired during the Super Bowl that year. The company had   also sponsored for years a series of music festivals/farmers   markets (dubbed Cultivate), and last year, Chipotle rolled   out a series of ads, called ""As Real as It Gets,"" with a   psychiatrist voiced by Jeffrey Tambor talking to famous comedians   in a giant Chipotle burrito. Brandt also said that the company was running spots on the   ""NBA playoffs, and season finales of top shows across a variety   of networks."" In other words, expensive spots. Chipotle's business model had been so good prior to 2015,   because customers flocked to the brand without excessive   marketing. Now, it looks as though Niccol and company will be   spending more on tactics prior management already attempted. Bringing chorizo back?! Another pillar of Niccol's plan revolves around menu   innovation. Again, this is something that Steve Ells already   tried in 2016 and 2017. Niccol says, ""There was no validated menu   innovation pipeline, a general lack of customer understanding,   and no real process for scaling and commercializing   innovation."" I think that gives Steve Ells short shrift. Chipotle had   already unveiled several new menu items since late 2015,   including both chorizo and queso sauce. Ells also established the   NEXT kitchen    in New York City in 2017, where the company develops new ideas   such as   bunuelos    desserts and new margaritas. What happened? Queso was   widely panned    (at least on the internet), and chorizo was eventually pulled   from restaurants. Interestingly, one of Niccol's new ideas is ... to bring   chorizo back. It's true. Apparently, some customers have voiced a longing   for chorizo, and Niccol is listening. But again, wasn't there a   reason prior management pulled it in the first place? Niccol has other ideas of course, but new menu items have the   potential to both increase cost of goods sold and add   complication to Chipotle's operations, which is why the company   had such a limited menu for so long. While these new items may   drive some incremental revenue, they will also come with   increased costs and offsets. Going digital ... again A final pillar of Niccol's plan is to increase digital   initiatives. Niccol touted a new partnership with food-delivery   service DoorDash to supplement the existing partnership with   Postmates, as well as plans to add delivery ordering options to a   revamped Chipotle app. Niccol also plans on moving Chipotle's   headquarters to Newport Beach, California, from Denver in order   to ""fill the skills gap"" he sees at the company. Again, I'm not sure what the thinking is here. Ex-   Starbucks    CTO Curt Garner already came to Chipotle over two years ago, and   the company has already had mobile ordering on its app for some   time. In addition, while California may have a better tech   workforce than Denver, costs of living are also way higher. Shareholder deja vu Investors have backed Niccol ever since this past winter, but   while it's possible he can execute on this strategy better than   his predecessor, he isn't Superman. If these initiatives don't   materially improve results soon, Chipotle's stock could swoon   again. I'd be cautious.   10 stocks we like better than Chipotle Mexican     Grill       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

"    It was only a couple of years ago that fast casual dining was the biggest trend in the restaurant industry. The dramatic shift to fast casual restaurants was mainly pushed by an increased interest, especially from millennials, in healthier food options that don't break the bank. This style of dining, which is a mix between traditional fast food restaurants and fine dining, saw its sales grow at a high rate of 10 to 11 percent annually from 2011 to 2016, according to research provider Euromonitor International  .  Riding off the highs of being at the center of the restaurant industry, a great amount of fast casual restaurants went public or saw share prices soar between 2013 and 2015, including Shake Shack SHAK  , Chipotle CMG  , Habit Restaurants HABT  , Potbelly PBPB  , Noodles & Company NDLS  , Zoe's Kitchen ZOES  , El Pollo Loco LOCO  , and Panera Bread. At the forefront of this trend was Mexican chain Chipotle, the perfect answer to the younger generation's desire for higher-quality ingredients with the same convenience of fast food. At its peak the company's stock was at $758.61 per share on Aug 5, 2015 and looked to be destined to take over the entire restaurant industry-until disaster struck. An E.coli outbreak  in 2015 caused shares of the company to drastically fall and struggle to recover, with the stock closing 2017 at just $289.03. Recent performance hasn't looked that good for other fast casual restaurants either, as other main leaders, such as Noodles & Company, have struggled as well.  The restaurant which specializes in pastas, salads, and soups priced its IPO at $18 per share and ended that day at $36.75. Now, the company trades at only around $11, a 70% drop from its first day's closing price. In 2017, the company reported a net loss of $37.5 million.  Drivers of the Downfall  Although food-borne illnesses were a major reason for Chipotle's fall, there were other underlying factors that led to the steady demise of the company and the fast casual industry as a whole. Primarily, the fast food industry, once proclaimed dead by experts, has been able to fight back and again begin to take over the restaurant industry. Typical fast food giants like McDonald's MCD  have been able to respond to by providing new premium  and higher quality menu options, while still serving meals at a slightly lower cost than fast casual restaurants typically do. The move by fast food restaurants to cater to new dining trends has made fast casual establishments lose much of their cultural significance, which is what drove most of their success initially. Fast food giants have also further countered and improved their relevance with younger generations through social media marketing. An example is another classic fast food staple, Wendy's WEN  , and the company's frequent and popular use of Twitter responses to generate publicity.  How Fast Casual Can Rebound  The restaurants that were once all the hype can't afford to simply depend on better ingredients anymore. New strategies need to be implemented that differentiate this style of dining from their fast food counterparts. The leader of the fast casual revolution, Chipotle, has already made steps towards that goal. Newly appointed CEO Brian Niccol, who was previously the CEO of rival Taco Bell, recently stated goals of becoming not just a food brand but a ""purpose-driven lifestyle brand"". In addition, Niccol aims to slowly start rolling in new menu options  , increased mobile ordering, and a stronger social media presence. The new CEO understands that the company can't be stagnant in a market that is full of innovation.  All of the changes are meant to bring Chipotle back to center of attention for consumers, just as it was about three years ago.  Bottom Line  As the battle for the restaurant industry continues, investors should continue to wait to see what moves the leaders in the fast casual trend decide to make. This helps explain some of why Chipotle and Noodles & Company are both currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). There is clearly potential, as the Chipotle stock has risen more than 40% since Niccol took over on March 5. Its Q2 earnings report, which will be released on July 26, will be a vital indicator as to where the stock will go in the future and if Niccol's strategic initiatives are truly paying off.  Based on our Zacks Consensus Estimates, the company's Q2 earnings are expected to move to $2.78 per share, a 19.8% surge from the year-ago period.

"   makeZacksArticleAd();Noodles & CompanyNDLS is scheduled to report second-quarter 2018 numbers on Jul 18, after market close.After struggling with soft consumer demand, along with declining comps in 2017 and the first quarter of 2018, the company is expected to make a comeback in the second quarter. The company's various initiatives to sustain top-line momentum and restrict costs are expected to have paid off in the second quarter.Notably, shares of Noodles & Company have rallied a whopping 186.7% in the past year, outperforming the industry 's collective growth of 1.5%.Let's take a look at how the company's second quarter will shape up.Top Line to Improve on Sales-Building EffortsNoddle's & Company's major sales-building initiatives like streamlining of menu and innovation, introduction of new cooking procedures, effective marketing strategy, increased focus on the off-premise business and investments in technology-driven initiatives like digital ordering are expected to have positively contributed to the top line in the second quarter. Despite the 5.3% decline in revenues in the first quarter, we expect its revenues to grow in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter's revenues is pegged at $114.8 million, suggesting 1.8% growth from the year-ago quarter.Meanwhile, in the first quarter, comps were affected by a shift in the timing of the Easter holiday. System-wide comps in the first quarter declined 0.2% and that of the company-owned restaurants fell 0.3%. Defying the trend of sluggish comps, the consensus estimate projects both system wide and company-owned comps to grow 2.3% in the second quarter.Cost Cuts to Boost EarningsWhile high costs from restaurant operation and increased labor expenses might have been a potential threat to Noodles & Company's earnings, the company has been undertaking the task of closing underperforming restaurants, which will in turn improve margins. In fact, the company successfully cut down operating expenses by drastically lowering pre-opening costs.Total costs and expenses in the first quarter declined 99.2% year over year, owing to a sharp decline in pre-opening costs. Cost of sales and labor also declined 8.8% and 7.6%, respectively, from the year-ago quarter. Restaurant contribution margin was 12.9% in the first quarter of 2018 compared with 11% in the first quarter of 2017, reflecting an increase of 190 basis points. We expect the upside trend in margins to continue in the second quarter as well. Subsequently, the consensus estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at 3 cents, reflecting a 200% increase from the prior-year quarter.Our Quantitative Model Does Not Predict a BeatNoodles & Company does not have the right combination of two main ingredients - a positive  Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher - for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP:  The company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

"Reuters  @media screen and (max-device-width: 480px){body{ font-size:30pt !important;}}    By Anna Irrera and Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi NEW YORK/ZURICH, July 19 (Reuters) - Swiss regulators are stepping up efforts to halt an exodus of cryptocurrency projects from the country, after two of only a handful of banks active in the nascent sector shut their doors on it in the last year. The departures, which industry sources fear will continue, mean Switzerland is losing business to offshore rivals including Liechtenstein, Gibraltar and the Cayman Islands, where banks are more welcoming.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','',''); The wealthy Swiss canton of Zug, for example, has been dubbed ""Crypto Valley"", with 200-300 virtual currency entities opening there in recent years. Zug's finance director, Heinz Taennler, says they may leave if the government does not take steps to give them access to the banking system, without which they struggle to function. ""All their banking relationships are going to Liechtenstein,"" he told Reuters. ""These are hundreds of jobs that have been created, and every job is important."" Thomas Moser, an alternate member of the governing board at the Swiss National Bank (SNB), said some cryptocurrency companies had asked the central to intervene. ""They raised concerns about problems with opening bank accounts, which was a worry for them, and asked for help,"" Moser told Reuters. ""I said this was not something the SNB dealt with, but they should speak with FINMA. FINMA, Switzerland's financial market supervisor, has held discussions with the SNB and bankers' association on how to make banks more accessible to cryptocurrency ventures. ""We would not want to close the door on the opportunities that such innovation (cryptocurrencies) might bring,"" Moser added. Providing the legal framework to launch ICOs and for banks to do business with cryptocurrency companies is not easy. The risk of fraud and lack of transparency about who owns cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether have made regulators around the world wary. The United States is among countries that are increasing scrutiny of the sector.   BANKS WARY Swiss banks are urging the authorities to give them more clarity on the rules that apply to cryptocurrency projects before providing services to the market, and at least two important players have withdrawn for now. Zuercher Kantonalbank (ZKB), the fourth largest Swiss bank and one of the few big banks in the world to welcome issuers of cryptocurrencies, has closed the accounts of more than 20 companies in the last year, industry sources told Reuters. A spokesman for ZKB declined to comment on any former or existing clients relationships, but said the bank does not do business with any cryptocurrency groups. Another large Swiss bank kicked out crypto project Smart Valor at around the same time, said a person familiar with the project. The source declined to name the bank. Only a handful of Switzerland's 250 banks ever allowed companies to deposit the cash equivalent of cryptocurrencies raised in ICOs. At least two still do, Reuters has established. But the involvement of a large bank like ZKB helped to establish Switzerland as an early cryptocurrency hub. ZKB and the bank that turned its back on Smart Valor began shutting their doors in October after a management feud severely damaged cryptocurrency project Tezos, which had conducted Zug's largest ICO, entrepreneurs and advisers said.  Swiss banks are worried because some companies that carried out ICOs did not do anti-money laundering (AML) checks on their contributors, industry sources said. This means the banks themselves could fall foul of AML rules.   LIECHTENSTEIN A WINNER ""A cautionary response from Swiss banks resulted in a pause or closure for most projects in the cryptocurrency space,""  said David Henderson, founder of the Swiss Sweetbridge Foundation, set up to conduct blockchain startup Sweetbridge's ICO. Sweetbridge was in the late stages of securing an account with ZKB, but the application was put on hold a few days after the Tezos scandal erupted, Henderson said. The project ultimately decided not to carry out its planned ICO through the Swiss foundation, setting up entities and bank accounts in Gibraltar and Liechtenstein instead. It is difficult for crypto-projects to use the funds they raise through ICOs if they are locked out of the banking system. Funds from ICOs are often originally raised in cryptocurrencies bitcoin and ether, which have limited use as a means of payment in the broader economy. ""I cannot pay salaries because our money is caught up there. We cannot move it,"" said the founder of a Swiss crypto-firm which has had accounts closed at three different banks. The banks have asked the firm to take out its money, but it is unable to do so without first finding another banking relationship, the founder added. At least two Swiss banks are still accepting ICO funds, according to checks by Reuters. These are Banca Zarattini, a small bank in the Italian-language canton Ticino, and Hypothekarbank Lenzburg, a regional lender located between Zurich and Basel, which recently began accepting crypto customers. Banca Zarattini only banks ICO companies with KYC (know-your-customer) and AML procedures that are in compliance with Swiss law, it said. Hypothekarbank Lenzburg said it had started to accept crytocurrency companies and could charge an initial assessment fee of up to 2,500 Swiss francs($2,500). Bank Frick in Liechtenstein has become a popular alternative for Swiss entities struggling to secure accounts. It banks around 160 crypto-enterprises or projects, of which 60 are in the process of setting up an ICO, the bank told Reuters. The bank, however, declined 90 percent of account requests from cryptocurrency companies and only accepts ICOs based onshore in Switzerland or Liechtenstein, it said.   RULES AND REASSURANCES Despite the challenges, Switzerland is working on new rules to reassure banks and encourage them to accept the accounts of cryptocurrency companies. The country has dropped from second place in 2017 to sixth this year in a country ranking of the sum of ICO funds raised,  according to a study published by PwC and the Crypto Valley Association in June. The Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands topped the list. In May, Swiss Finance Minister Ueli Maurer invited FINMA, the central bank and the Swiss Bankers Association (SBA) to a roundtable discussion on bank accounts for cryptocurrencies. After the meeting, the SBA set up a working group to compile a set of checks and conditions that all banks could follow when opening an account for cryptocurrency firms. ""Banks are currently hesitant to open business accounts for companies with particular touchpoints to ICOs and cryptocurrencies - due to risks such as fraud or money laundering,"" SBA said in a statement. Zug finance director Taennler said the aim set out during the meeting, which he attended, was to have a set of FINMA-approved guidelines for assessing prospective cryptocurrency clients by the year-end. FINMA has already issued separate guidelines to spell out how Swiss AML rules and securities regulations apply to various ICOs. But securities rules are less stringent in Switzerland than in the United States, where the Securities and Exchange Commission has toughened its stance on ICOs.  This makes it more risky for banks in Switzerland to be involved with ICO projects which may have raised money from U.S. contributors and could fall under the purview of the SEC. Switzerland's authorities have said they want to create conditions for the country to remain competitive but with no room for scams or financial crime.

"Reuters  @media screen and (max-device-width: 480px){body{ font-size:30pt !important;}}    By Anna Irrera and Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi NEW YORK/ZURICH, July 19 (Reuters) - Swiss regulators are stepping up efforts to halt an exodus of cryptocurrency projects from the country, after two of only a handful of banks active in the nascent sector shut their doors on it in the last year. The departures, which industry sources fear will continue, mean Switzerland is losing business to offshore rivals including Liechtenstein, Gibraltar and the Cayman Islands, where banks are more welcoming.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','',''); The wealthy Swiss canton of Zug, for example, has been dubbed ""Crypto Valley"", with 200-300 virtual currency entities opening there in recent years. Zug's finance director, Heinz Taennler, says they may leave if the government does not take steps to give them access to the banking system, without which they struggle to function. ""All their banking relationships are going to Liechtenstein,"" he told Reuters. ""These are hundreds of jobs that have been created, and every job is important."" Thomas Moser, an alternate member of the governing board at the Swiss National Bank (SNB), said some cryptocurrency companies had asked the central to intervene. ""They raised concerns about problems with opening bank accounts, which was a worry for them, and asked for help,"" Moser told Reuters. ""I said this was not something the SNB dealt with, but they should speak with FINMA. FINMA, Switzerland's financial market supervisor, has held discussions with the SNB and bankers' association on how to make banks more accessible to cryptocurrency ventures. ""We would not want to close the door on the opportunities that such innovation (cryptocurrencies) might bring,"" Moser added. Providing the legal framework to launch ICOs and for banks to do business with cryptocurrency companies is not easy. The risk of fraud and lack of transparency about who owns cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether have made regulators around the world wary. The United States is among countries that are increasing scrutiny of the sector.   BANKS WARY Swiss banks are urging the authorities to give them more clarity on the rules that apply to cryptocurrency projects before providing services to the market, and at least two important players have withdrawn for now. Zuercher Kantonalbank (ZKB), the fourth largest Swiss bank and one of the few big banks in the world to welcome issuers of cryptocurrencies, has closed the accounts of more than 20 companies in the last year, industry sources told Reuters. A spokesman for ZKB declined to comment on any former or existing clients relationships, but said the bank does not do business with any cryptocurrency groups. Another large Swiss bank kicked out crypto project Smart Valor at around the same time, said a person familiar with the project. The source declined to name the bank. Only a handful of Switzerland's 250 banks ever allowed companies to deposit the cash equivalent of cryptocurrencies raised in ICOs. At least two still do, Reuters has established. But the involvement of a large bank like ZKB helped to establish Switzerland as an early cryptocurrency hub. ZKB and the bank that turned its back on Smart Valor began shutting their doors in October after a management feud severely damaged cryptocurrency project Tezos, which had conducted Zug's largest ICO, entrepreneurs and advisers said.  Swiss banks are worried because some companies that carried out ICOs did not do anti-money laundering (AML) checks on their contributors, industry sources said. This means the banks themselves could fall foul of AML rules.   LIECHTENSTEIN A WINNER ""A cautionary response from Swiss banks resulted in a pause or closure for most projects in the cryptocurrency space,""  said David Henderson, founder of the Swiss Sweetbridge Foundation, set up to conduct blockchain startup Sweetbridge's ICO. Sweetbridge was in the late stages of securing an account with ZKB, but the application was put on hold a few days after the Tezos scandal erupted, Henderson said. The project ultimately decided not to carry out its planned ICO through the Swiss foundation, setting up entities and bank accounts in Gibraltar and Liechtenstein instead. It is difficult for crypto-projects to use the funds they raise through ICOs if they are locked out of the banking system. Funds from ICOs are often originally raised in cryptocurrencies bitcoin and ether, which have limited use as a means of payment in the broader economy. ""I cannot pay salaries because our money is caught up there. We cannot move it,"" said the founder of a Swiss crypto-firm which has had accounts closed at three different banks. The banks have asked the firm to take out its money, but it is unable to do so without first finding another banking relationship, the founder added. At least two Swiss banks are still accepting ICO funds, according to checks by Reuters. These are Banca Zarattini, a small bank in the Italian-language canton Ticino, and Hypothekarbank Lenzburg, a regional lender located between Zurich and Basel, which recently began accepting crypto customers. Banca Zarattini only banks ICO companies with KYC (know-your-customer) and AML procedures that are in compliance with Swiss law, it said. Hypothekarbank Lenzburg said it had started to accept crytocurrency companies and could charge an initial assessment fee of up to 2,500 Swiss francs($2,500). Bank Frick in Liechtenstein has become a popular alternative for Swiss entities struggling to secure accounts. It banks around 160 crypto-enterprises or projects, of which 60 are in the process of setting up an ICO, the bank told Reuters. The bank, however, declined 90 percent of account requests from cryptocurrency companies and only accepts ICOs based onshore in Switzerland or Liechtenstein, it said.   RULES AND REASSURANCES Despite the challenges, Switzerland is working on new rules to reassure banks and encourage them to accept the accounts of cryptocurrency companies. The country has dropped from second place in 2017 to sixth this year in a country ranking of the sum of ICO funds raised,  according to a study published by PwC and the Crypto Valley Association in June. The Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands topped the list. In May, Swiss Finance Minister Ueli Maurer invited FINMA, the central bank and the Swiss Bankers Association (SBA) to a roundtable discussion on bank accounts for cryptocurrencies. After the meeting, the SBA set up a working group to compile a set of checks and conditions that all banks could follow when opening an account for cryptocurrency firms. ""Banks are currently hesitant to open business accounts for companies with particular touchpoints to ICOs and cryptocurrencies - due to risks such as fraud or money laundering,"" SBA said in a statement. Zug finance director Taennler said the aim set out during the meeting, which he attended, was to have a set of FINMA-approved guidelines for assessing prospective cryptocurrency clients by the year-end. FINMA has already issued separate guidelines to spell out how Swiss AML rules and securities regulations apply to various ICOs. But securities rules are less stringent in Switzerland than in the United States, where the Securities and Exchange Commission has toughened its stance on ICOs.  This makes it more risky for banks in Switzerland to be involved with ICO projects which may have raised money from U.S. contributors and could fall under the purview of the SEC. Switzerland's authorities have said they want to create conditions for the country to remain competitive but with no room for scams or financial crime. The finance ministry is also looking at the broader legal framework for blockchain technology and ICOs. Its findings will be presented to the federal government by the end of the year and will determine how the technology fits into existing Swiss laws and regulations.

"    When you were a young'un, your parents may have sat you down   to talk about the ""birds and the bees."" Now it's time to turn the   tables and address another uncomfortable topic: their   finances. Such conversations mark a reversal in the traditional   parent-child dynamic, and also can be fraught with concerns over   independence, trust and mortality. As a result, these talks often   don't happen at all, and a perceived lack of urgency is to blame,   according to a 2018 survey conducted by Wells Fargo. Roughly one-third of parents over the age of 60 say they've   never discussed later-life needs with family, including   inheritance plans, beneficiaries, important documents or   designated representatives, according to the survey. Meanwhile,   adult children worry such conversations will cause conflict or   make it seem as though they're after their parents' money.makeArticleAd(); As daunting as it may seem, it's important to have ""the talk""   about finances with your parents to help protect them from scams   and elder abuse, which cost Americans more than $36 billion each   year, according to financial services firm True Link Financial.   These conversations also ensure that a rapid-response plan is in   place in the event of disability and that there are no surprises   after your parents die, says Ron Long, head of regulatory affairs   and elder client initiatives at Wells Fargo Advisors. These four tips can open lines of communication. 1. Start with one conversation When's a good time to sit your parents down for a hard   conversation about their financial well-being, plans for the   future and important legal and financial documents like a will,   power of attorney or health care directives? The twelfth of   never, for most children. Don't wait for tragedy to strike. A study by Ameriprise   Financial found that a life-altering incident was the trigger for   90% of children who'd actually discussed estate planning with   their parents.  » Unfamiliar with estate planning?     See our   7-step checklist  Instead, carve out time for a family meeting - perhaps on   Mother's Day, Father's Day or the Friday after Thanksgiving -   when all the children are present, Long recommends. ""It's a good   way to get the conversation started and then you can do a   refresher or update down the road."" The first conversation should serve as a door-opener. There   are weighty decisions at play - which may change over time with   your parents' mental or physical health - so don't expect a   one-and-done conversation. 2. Begin with the basics Talking about money inspires reactions ranging from secretive   to forthright. Even if your parents aren't particularly prickly   about discussing their finances, it's prudent to ease into such   conversations. Long says a strategy that's ""very helpful"" is approaching   discussions from a group-planning perspective - sharing what   end-of-life goals you're considering and asking your parents   about theirs. ""Remember, these are subjects that a lot of older   folks hold close to their hearts,"" he says. Be sensitive when starting that initial conversation. Think   less interrogative (how much money's at stake and who gets what?)   and more collaborative (exchanging information about where   accounts are held or who has power of attorney). 3. Broach serious topics Once you've established a rapport, tackle topics that make   either you or your parents uncomfortable, including the morose   (funeral arrangements or declining health) and the dangerous   (financial scams targeting seniors that could wipe out their   savings). Don't let the prospect of an awkward conversation now create a   bigger headache in the future. Strive for this balance:   confronting reality head-on without infantilizing or offending   your parents. A bad way to deal? Shutting down future   conversations when talks are strained. A better way to deal?   Involving other family members to facilitate discussion or   working with a financial advisor to handle trickier topics.

You're asking them to part   with sensitive information; promise a judgment-free zone in   return. Because of the prevalence of financial abuse - it's estimated   one in five elders have been impacted - urge your parents to flag   potential scams.

"   InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere's good news for Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) shareholders who've had the guts to stick with the stock and resist the temptation to take profits. Shares are up 65% just since early April. And another batch of encouraging AMD stock news materialized this week - Stifel believes the chipmaker is doing even better than expected right now, meriting a higher price target.makeArticleAd();Maybe it does. Though archrival Nvidia  (NASDAQ: NVDA ) continues to crush it on all fronts while former partner-turned-competitor Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) is sure to make waves, there's a broad-rising tide on the technology front that could lift the AMD boat just as well as it lifts any other player's.In other words, Stifel isn't thinking crazy here.20 Russian Stocks to Watch After Trump's Helsinki GaffeOn the other hand, there are some major valuation concerns that need to be addressed.What He SaidAnalyst Kevin Cassidy made the call, explaining ""We continue recommending the AMD shares as a higher percentage of its revenue transitions to the newer, higher margin Zen-based CPUs,"" prompting Stifel to raise its price target from $17 to $21. That's 25% above the current price of AMD stock, and 118% higher than where shares were trading just three months ago.Stifel's optimism wasn't dished out for no particular reason - much of the AMD stock news of late has been bullish.Case in point: Analytical outfit Detwiler Fenton noted last month   that ""the fundamentals that underpin the CPU server market are fundamentally changing; with more complex competition coming online from x86 architectures (e.g., AMD) and in the future we will likely see ARM CPUs join the mix as well."" He added that the shift toward public cloud platforms ""would not bode well for current market leader INTC.""Stifel's Cassidy acknowledged the same on Monday, explaining ""The surprise upside may come from the company's Epyc server CPU gaining traction ahead of consensus expectations for 5% unit market share exiting"" the fourth quarter of 2018.It's not just the server market that's paving the way for Advanced Micro Devices' growth, however. As was noted, there's a broad rebound for the PC market, as consumers and corporations are finally being forced to upgrade their hardware. Cassidy added, ""Given the many positive PC industry data points for 2Q18, we believe shipments for AMD's Zen-based PC CPU line-up tracked in-line to slightly better than management's guidance,"" noting IDC's number-crunching that indicated PC shipments grew 2.7% in the second quarter.The analyst concluded, ""We expect AMD to benefit from the stronger than expected results, especially given the trends for enterprise, gaming, and high-end notebooks, all markets in which AMD has improved its competitive position through its Ryzen processors.""What He Didn't SayStill, a price target of $21 translates into a forward-looking price-to-earnings ratio of almost 34, based on next year's projected per-share profits of 62 cents . Even with a respectable beat of those expectations, AMD stock would still be richly, dangerously priced.Were the company bulletproof or in a strong position to hold onto the 12 points' worth of GPU revenue share Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore says AMD has gained over the course of the past six quarters , such a valuation might be justified. Moore believes, however, that rival Nvidia will soon be taking graphics card sales back. Specifically, next-generation GPUs to be unveiled at Gamescom in August is likely to kickstart a recovery of Nvidia's share of the graphics card market.Also arriving in August will be Intel's 9th generation of its Coffee Lake CPU , poised to take on AMD's Ryzen.In the meantime, China's Chengdu Haiguang IC Design Co. (Hygon) is making fully licensed CPUs that are - for all intents and purposes -  near-perfect copies of AMD's x86 processors . Though it's possible they could by stymied by the brewing trade war, they still pose - and point to - a significant threat.These collective potential pitfalls leave no room for error from a company with a stock priced at more than 30 times next year's expected bottom line.Bottom Line on AMD StockIt's encouraging AMD stock news, to be sure. But, Stifel's optimism is also rather speculative, ignoring the risks at hand.That doesn't mean Advanced Micro Devices won't reach $21 sooner or later, and perhaps even sooner than later. Hype is an incredible force, and can't be dismissed. Good reason or not, if it's what prods a stock higher, then it's a trade worth taking.7 Alternative Internet of Things Stocks to BuyJust take the call with a grain of salt, knowing that Stifel could change its mind at a moment's notice, pulling the rug out from underneath shares at the first sign that AMD isn't acing it on each and every front.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

"   makeZacksArticleAd();The cryptocurrency market has finally sprung back to life after being plagued by low trade volumes for successive weeks. On Jul 17, Bitcoin - the world's largest cryptocurrency -surged to its highest levels since the first week of June.Bitcoin gained $700 in under an hour to go past $7,000 on Tuesday. The rally also showered gains on the overall virtual currency market, which grew by a little more than $20 billion.Those who had written off the cryptocurrency market can expect this momentum to continue in the near term. The next rally in the space is likely to be sparked by cryptocurrency regulations to be initiated by the government of South Korea. Under such circumstances, investing in stocks of companies related to the virtual currency market seems prudent.Bitcoin Hits Its Highest Levels in 5 WeeksThe virtual coin whizzed past the $7,000 level to settle at $7,483 on Jul 17. This marked it highest settlement in the past five weeks. Further, the price of bitcoin shot up around 10% in just 30 minutes, followed by a surge in its trade volume.Within an hour of this spike in BTC, the prices of other virtual currencies such as Bitcoin Cash, ether, Ripple, and EOS increased in the range of 7-10%. This also resulted in the overall cryptocurrency market witnessing a surge from $272 billion to $292 billion.This rally followed gains that were made a day earlier on Jul 16, after BlackRock (BLK) announced that it has established a ""working group"" to study the cryptocurrency market as well as the blockchain technology. The BTC had last rallied on such a scale on Apr 9, when it surged from $6,000 to $8,000 in just 30 minutes.What Sparked The Rally?After weeks of low trade volume, the crypto market witnessed a recovery in liquidity on Tuesday. In just two days, the volume of bitcoin against Tether (USDT) has shot up to $300 million from $100 million on Binance - world's biggest virtual currency exchange. This increase in trade volume primarily sparked the rally.Despite encouraging Relative Strength Index (RSI) and momentum average convergence divergence (MACD) of bitcoin, low trade volumes for the past few weeks had subdued the crypto rally.Moreover, government initiatives and positive developments in world's largest crypto markets such as Japan and South Korea has not only pushed up demand for cryptos, but also the overall market.4 Best PicksA corrective rally on Jul 17, which resulted in a sudden increase in cryptocurrency trade volumes, helped bitcoin blast past the $7,000 mark. Further, consistent government initiatives by the world's leading virtual currency markets have propelled the overall sector higher.In this context, we have selected four crypto related stocks that are expected to gain from these factors.

"     Cadence Design Systems Inc. CDNS  is set to report second-quarter 2018 results on Jul 23. Notably, the company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters while coming in line in the remaining one, recording an average positive surprise of 2.81%. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, Cadence delivered non-GAAP earnings of 40 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents. Revenues increased 8.5% year over year to $517.3 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $506 million. Robust adoption of the company's digital and signoff, custom and analog, and IP solutions along with an ever expanding customer base fueled overall year-over-year growth. The company has also witnessed significant demand from aerospace and defense sectors.  What to Expect?  For second-quarter 2018, Cadence expects total revenues in the range of $510-$520 million and non-GAAP earnings in the range of 39-41 cents per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 40 cents per share, up 17.7% year over year. Revenues are estimated to be $515.3 million, up 7.6% year over year. The company raised 2018 outlook expecting the first-quarter momentum to sustain. Revenues are now projected to be in the range of $2.055-$2.085 billion, up from $2.015-$2.055 billion anticipated earlier. Non-GAAP earnings are now guided in the range of $1.57-$1.65 per share, raised from previous band of $1.50-$1.60.  Factor Likely to Impact Q2 Results    Collaboration & Product Rollouts: Key Catalyst   Cadence is on a collaboration spree with industry leading cloud infrastructures. At Design Automation Conference (""DAC""), the company collaborated with Microsoft's MSFT  Azure, Amazon Web Services (""AWS"") and Alphabet's Google Cloud platform to enable smooth design development of electronic systems and semiconductors. In the Digital IC Design and Signoff segment, the company reinforced its collaboration with Imec to tapeout the industry's first ever 3nm test chip. The chip complemented company's innovative digital implementation tools with Imec's development infrastructure. It is designed to aid digital transformation of mobile architecture at advanced nodes. Moreover, 7 nm design of Cadence has been adopted by notable companies. A major defense contractor will leverage Cadence's digital flow for its in-house chip design. Going ahead impressive adoption of flagship - DDR and PCI - products remains key catalysts. The company unveiled Tensilica Vision Q6, enhanced processor for embedded vision for on-device AI applications. Further, Cadence Tensilica Vision P5 DSP enabled GEO Semiconductor's (""GEO"") GW5400 camera video processor to run company's in-camera computer vision. The DSP platform's advanced driver assistance systems (""ADAS"") capabilities will enhance automated driving experience. Cadence together with Advanced Semiconductor Engineering (""ASE"") unveiled a System-in-Package (""SiP"") EDA solution to effectively verify and design Fan-Out Chip-on-Substrate (""FOCoS"") multi-die packages. The solution will enable ASE to deliver high-performance futuristic package technologies. The company's Custom IC Design segment is benefiting from its sustained focus on bringing in new and innovative products. Cadence enhanced Virtuoso custom IC design platform with innovative capabilities, including support for 5 nm nodes. These new enhancements shall improve electronic system and IC design productivity. Cadence also delivered a broad cloud portfolio which enables electronic semiconductors and systems to thrive. The company claims the new Cadence Cloud portfolio to be a first-of-a-kind solution, leveraging Cadence-managed as well as customer-managed cloud infrastructure. The infrastructure enables customers' entire design journey or peak to function smoothly. The company also launched the Palladium Cloud solution. The customers will have the option to deploy this new emulation solution with the company's other Cloud solutions. Furthermore, Cadence Liberate Trio Characterization Suite was also introduced. The company claims it to be the ""industry's first unified library characterization tool"". The advanced ML techniques help the designers predict critical corners and decide the corners required to be characterized. The innovative cloud-ready solutions expand the company's portfolio in an effective manner. The strong collaborations and smart product launches augur well for Cadence. Robust adoption of the company's digital and signoff, custom and analog, and IP solutions along with an ever expanding customer base remains a positive. Additionally, the company is also witnessing traction in aerospace and defense sectors, which is a tailwind. We believe that all these factors will positively impact the company's results in the to-be reported quarter and bolster its customer base going ahead.   Cadence Design Systems, Inc.

"   InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) has been on fire since its last earnings report in late April. While AMD stock wasn't trading at its absolute lows when it reported, it was pretty close. Anyway, the quarter helped propel shares from roughly $10 to more than $16 currently.makeArticleAd();10 Dow Jones Titans to Buy NowCan investors expect the same reaction when the company reports on July 25?I love AMD stock and was pounding the table when shares were below $10 for a variety of reasons - we'll get into that in a second. But below that mark, the risk/reward ratio was so attractive that it made no sense to bet against it. Up near $16.50, though, it's unreasonable to expect another 65% rally over the ensuing three months.Sizing Up AMD Stock Into EarningsSo, what made me suggest buying AMD stock with both hands when shares were below $10? Obviously, hindsight is 20/20 and after the huge rally - which admittedly and importantly, we didn't catch all of - it seems obvious as to why we bought. But, at the time, the rhetoric couldn't have been much worse.Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) was eating AMD's lunch, while Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) closed the gap on too many levels for AMD to compete. Throw in AMD's less attractive financial situation and lower margins and there was no point in buying the name.At least, that's what the bears made one think.In reality, AMD continues to improve mightily. The company's debt continues to fall, while revenue and profit continue to rise. Further, gross margins have improved over the last several years and, while NVDA and INTC have better operating and net margins, AMD is finally in positive territory too. AMD has also become cash-flow positive - another bullish development.Is AMD the strongest company, financially speaking? No. But in my opinion, too many investors are looking at the trailing results for AMD and not what it is presently doing or should do in the future.In that regard, last quarter, management said it expects to generate revenue of $1.675 billion to $1.775 billion this quarter. That easily beat consensus expectations of $1.58 billion.Still, going into the report, analyst estimates are ""only"" at $1.72 billion. So, if AMD can come in at the high end of its range or even beat its own range, then shares could have more upside. As for earnings, analysts expect 13 cents per share, up from just 2 cents per share in the same quarter a year ago.For what it's worth, NVDA management also suggested that this quarter should be strong.Trading AMD Stock   Click to EnlargeSo, how to do we trade AMD stock ahead of earnings?I don't recommend options very often, but a few weeks ago I suggested selling put options on AMD stock. The thought was if shares rallied, we'd see the premium fall to zero and we'd collect our entire profit. If the stock fell, though, we'd have a cost basis near $14.50, right near a vital level of support.That level can be seen on the chart above. Simply put, AMD stock ran too far, too fast from sub-$10 to more than $17 in just a few months time. The rally was practically straight up.After digesting the move, it's clear that the $14.50 to $15 area is pretty decent support. That range also contains the 50-day moving average. Should that level give way, the $12.50 to $13 range should also be strong support. That contains the backside of AMD's prior downtrend resistance line, as well as the 100-day and 200-day moving averages.7 Alternative Internet of Things Stocks to BuyEven though shares are off the highs, we could get a Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) type of setup where AMD stock pulls back on earnings. Even a decline down to $14.50 would still mean the stock is up 45% from its April earnings report.Short-term investors could play for a possible rally into earnings. If the stock does do that, I definitely want to wait before entering AMD until after its earnings report.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell .

"Reuters  @media screen and (max-device-width: 480px){body{ font-size:30pt !important;}}    By Anna Irrera and Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi NEW YORK/ZURICH, July 19 (Reuters) - Swiss regulators are stepping up efforts to halt an exodus of cryptocurrency projects from the country, after two of only a handful of banks active in the nascent sector shut their doors on it in the last year. The departures, which industry sources fear will continue, mean Switzerland is losing business to offshore rivals including Liechtenstein, Gibraltar and the Cayman Islands, where banks are more welcoming.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','',''); The wealthy Swiss canton of Zug, for example, has been dubbed ""Crypto Valley"", with 200-300 virtual currency entities opening there in recent years. Zug's finance director, Heinz Taennler, says they may leave if the government does not take steps to give them access to the banking system, without which they struggle to function. ""All their banking relationships are going to Liechtenstein,"" he told Reuters. ""These are hundreds of jobs that have been created, and every job is important."" Thomas Moser, an alternate member of the governing board at the Swiss National Bank (SNB), said some cryptocurrency companies had asked the central to intervene. ""They raised concerns about problems with opening bank accounts, which was a worry for them, and asked for help,"" Moser told Reuters. ""I said this was not something the SNB dealt with, but they should speak with FINMA. FINMA, Switzerland's financial market supervisor, has held discussions with the SNB and bankers' association on how to make banks more accessible to cryptocurrency ventures. ""We would not want to close the door on the opportunities that such innovation (cryptocurrencies) might bring,"" Moser added. Providing the legal framework to launch ICOs and for banks to do business with cryptocurrency companies is not easy. The risk of fraud and lack of transparency about who owns cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether have made regulators around the world wary. The United States is among countries that are increasing scrutiny of the sector.   BANKS WARY Swiss banks are urging the authorities to give them more clarity on the rules that apply to cryptocurrency projects before providing services to the market, and at least two important players have withdrawn for now. Zuercher Kantonalbank (ZKB), the fourth largest Swiss bank and one of the few big banks in the world to welcome issuers of cryptocurrencies, has closed the accounts of more than 20 companies in the last year, industry sources told Reuters. A spokesman for ZKB declined to comment on any former or existing clients relationships, but said the bank does not do business with any cryptocurrency groups. Another large Swiss bank kicked out crypto project Smart Valor at around the same time, said a person familiar with the project. The source declined to name the bank. Only a handful of Switzerland's 250 banks ever allowed companies to deposit the cash equivalent of cryptocurrencies raised in ICOs. At least two still do, Reuters has established. But the involvement of a large bank like ZKB helped to establish Switzerland as an early cryptocurrency hub. ZKB and the bank that turned its back on Smart Valor began shutting their doors in October after a management feud severely damaged cryptocurrency project Tezos, which had conducted Zug's largest ICO, entrepreneurs and advisers said.  Swiss banks are worried because some companies that carried out ICOs did not do anti-money laundering (AML) checks on their contributors, industry sources said. This means the banks themselves could fall foul of AML rules.   LIECHTENSTEIN A WINNER ""A cautionary response from Swiss banks resulted in a pause or closure for most projects in the cryptocurrency space,""  said David Henderson, founder of the Swiss Sweetbridge Foundation, set up to conduct blockchain startup Sweetbridge's ICO. Sweetbridge was in the late stages of securing an account with ZKB, but the application was put on hold a few days after the Tezos scandal erupted, Henderson said. The project ultimately decided not to carry out its planned ICO through the Swiss foundation, setting up entities and bank accounts in Gibraltar and Liechtenstein instead. It is difficult for crypto-projects to use the funds they raise through ICOs if they are locked out of the banking system. Funds from ICOs are often originally raised in cryptocurrencies bitcoin and ether, which have limited use as a means of payment in the broader economy. ""I cannot pay salaries because our money is caught up there. We cannot move it,"" said the founder of a Swiss crypto-firm which has had accounts closed at three different banks. The banks have asked the firm to take out its money, but it is unable to do so without first finding another banking relationship, the founder added. At least two Swiss banks are still accepting ICO funds, according to checks by Reuters. These are Banca Zarattini, a small bank in the Italian-language canton Ticino, and Hypothekarbank Lenzburg, a regional lender located between Zurich and Basel, which recently began accepting crypto customers. Banca Zarattini only banks ICO companies with KYC (know-your-customer) and AML procedures that are in compliance with Swiss law, it said. Hypothekarbank Lenzburg said it had started to accept crytocurrency companies and could charge an initial assessment fee of up to 2,500 Swiss francs($2,500). Bank Frick in Liechtenstein has become a popular alternative for Swiss entities struggling to secure accounts. It banks around 160 crypto-enterprises or projects, of which 60 are in the process of setting up an ICO, the bank told Reuters. The bank, however, declined 90 percent of account requests from cryptocurrency companies and only accepts ICOs based onshore in Switzerland or Liechtenstein, it said.   RULES AND REASSURANCES Despite the challenges, Switzerland is working on new rules to reassure banks and encourage them to accept the accounts of cryptocurrency companies. The country has dropped from second place in 2017 to sixth this year in a country ranking of the sum of ICO funds raised,  according to a study published by PwC and the Crypto Valley Association in June. The Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands topped the list. In May, Swiss Finance Minister Ueli Maurer invited FINMA, the central bank and the Swiss Bankers Association (SBA) to a roundtable discussion on bank accounts for cryptocurrencies. After the meeting, the SBA set up a working group to compile a set of checks and conditions that all banks could follow when opening an account for cryptocurrency firms. ""Banks are currently hesitant to open business accounts for companies with particular touchpoints to ICOs and cryptocurrencies - due to risks such as fraud or money laundering,"" SBA said in a statement. Zug finance director Taennler said the aim set out during the meeting, which he attended, was to have a set of FINMA-approved guidelines for assessing prospective cryptocurrency clients by the year-end. FINMA has already issued separate guidelines to spell out how Swiss AML rules and securities regulations apply to various ICOs. But securities rules are less stringent in Switzerland than in the United States, where the Securities and Exchange Commission has toughened its stance on ICOs.  This makes it more risky for banks in Switzerland to be involved with ICO projects which may have raised money from U.S. contributors and could fall under the purview of the SEC. Switzerland's authorities have said they want to create conditions for the country to remain competitive but with no room for scams or financial crime. The finance ministry is also looking at the broader legal framework for blockchain technology and ICOs. Its findings will be presented to the federal government by the end of the year and will determine how the technology fits into existing Swiss laws and regulations.

"Reuters  @media screen and (max-device-width: 480px){body{ font-size:30pt !important;}}    By Anna Irrera and Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi NEW YORK/ZURICH, July 19 (Reuters) - Swiss regulators are stepping up efforts to halt an exodus of cryptocurrency projects from the country, after two of only a handful of banks active in the nascent sector shut their doors on it in the last year. The departures, which industry sources fear will continue, mean Switzerland is losing business to offshore rivals including Liechtenstein, Gibraltar and the Cayman Islands, where banks are more welcoming.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','',''); The wealthy Swiss canton of Zug, for example, has been dubbed ""Crypto Valley"", with 200-300 virtual currency entities opening there in recent years. Zug's finance director, Heinz Taennler, says they may leave if the government does not take steps to give them access to the banking system, without which they struggle to function. ""All their banking relationships are going to Liechtenstein,"" he told Reuters. ""These are hundreds of jobs that have been created, and every job is important."" Thomas Moser, an alternate member of the governing board at the Swiss National Bank (SNB), said some cryptocurrency companies had asked the central to intervene. ""They raised concerns about problems with opening bank accounts, which was a worry for them, and asked for help,"" Moser told Reuters. ""I said this was not something the SNB dealt with, but they should speak with FINMA. FINMA, Switzerland's financial market supervisor, has held discussions with the SNB and bankers' association on how to make banks more accessible to cryptocurrency ventures. ""We would not want to close the door on the opportunities that such innovation (cryptocurrencies) might bring,"" Moser added. Providing the legal framework to launch ICOs and for banks to do business with cryptocurrency companies is not easy. The risk of fraud and lack of transparency about who owns cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether have made regulators around the world wary. The United States is among countries that are increasing scrutiny of the sector.   BANKS WARY Swiss banks are urging the authorities to give them more clarity on the rules that apply to cryptocurrency projects before providing services to the market, and at least two important players have withdrawn for now. Zuercher Kantonalbank (ZKB), the fourth largest Swiss bank and one of the few big banks in the world to welcome issuers of cryptocurrencies, has closed the accounts of more than 20 companies in the last year, industry sources told Reuters. A spokesman for ZKB declined to comment on any former or existing clients relationships, but said the bank does not do business with any cryptocurrency groups. Another large Swiss bank kicked out crypto project Smart Valor at around the same time, said a person familiar with the project. The source declined to name the bank. Only a handful of Switzerland's 250 banks ever allowed companies to deposit the cash equivalent of cryptocurrencies raised in ICOs. At least two still do, Reuters has established. But the involvement of a large bank like ZKB helped to establish Switzerland as an early cryptocurrency hub. ZKB and the bank that turned its back on Smart Valor began shutting their doors in October after a management feud severely damaged cryptocurrency project Tezos, which had conducted Zug's largest ICO, entrepreneurs and advisers said.  Swiss banks are worried because some companies that carried out ICOs did not do anti-money laundering (AML) checks on their contributors, industry sources said. This means the banks themselves could fall foul of AML rules.   LIECHTENSTEIN A WINNER ""A cautionary response from Swiss banks resulted in a pause or closure for most projects in the cryptocurrency space,""  said David Henderson, founder of the Swiss Sweetbridge Foundation, set up to conduct blockchain startup Sweetbridge's ICO. Sweetbridge was in the late stages of securing an account with ZKB, but the application was put on hold a few days after the Tezos scandal erupted, Henderson said. The project ultimately decided not to carry out its planned ICO through the Swiss foundation, setting up entities and bank accounts in Gibraltar and Liechtenstein instead. It is difficult for crypto-projects to use the funds they raise through ICOs if they are locked out of the banking system. Funds from ICOs are often originally raised in cryptocurrencies bitcoin and ether, which have limited use as a means of payment in the broader economy. ""I cannot pay salaries because our money is caught up there. We cannot move it,"" said the founder of a Swiss crypto-firm which has had accounts closed at three different banks. The banks have asked the firm to take out its money, but it is unable to do so without first finding another banking relationship, the founder added. At least two Swiss banks are still accepting ICO funds, according to checks by Reuters. These are Banca Zarattini, a small bank in the Italian-language canton Ticino, and Hypothekarbank Lenzburg, a regional lender located between Zurich and Basel, which recently began accepting crypto customers. Banca Zarattini only banks ICO companies with KYC (know-your-customer) and AML procedures that are in compliance with Swiss law, it said. Hypothekarbank Lenzburg said it had started to accept crytocurrency companies and could charge an initial assessment fee of up to 2,500 Swiss francs($2,500). Bank Frick in Liechtenstein has become a popular alternative for Swiss entities struggling to secure accounts. It banks around 160 crypto-enterprises or projects, of which 60 are in the process of setting up an ICO, the bank told Reuters. The bank, however, declined 90 percent of account requests from cryptocurrency companies and only accepts ICOs based onshore in Switzerland or Liechtenstein, it said.

"    When you were a young'un, your parents may have sat you down   to talk about the ""birds and the bees."" Now it's time to turn the   tables and address another uncomfortable topic: their   finances. Such conversations mark a reversal in the traditional   parent-child dynamic, and also can be fraught with concerns over   independence, trust and mortality. As a result, these talks often   don't happen at all, and a perceived lack of urgency is to blame,   according to a 2018 survey conducted by Wells Fargo. Roughly one-third of parents over the age of 60 say they've   never discussed later-life needs with family, including   inheritance plans, beneficiaries, important documents or   designated representatives, according to the survey. Meanwhile,   adult children worry such conversations will cause conflict or   make it seem as though they're after their parents' money.makeArticleAd(); As daunting as it may seem, it's important to have ""the talk""   about finances with your parents to help protect them from scams   and elder abuse, which cost Americans more than $36 billion each   year, according to financial services firm True Link Financial.   These conversations also ensure that a rapid-response plan is in   place in the event of disability and that there are no surprises   after your parents die, says Ron Long, head of regulatory affairs   and elder client initiatives at Wells Fargo Advisors. These four tips can open lines of communication. 1. Start with one conversation When's a good time to sit your parents down for a hard   conversation about their financial well-being, plans for the   future and important legal and financial documents like a will,   power of attorney or health care directives? The twelfth of   never, for most children. Don't wait for tragedy to strike. A study by Ameriprise   Financial found that a life-altering incident was the trigger for   90% of children who'd actually discussed estate planning with   their parents.  » Unfamiliar with estate planning?     See our   7-step checklist  Instead, carve out time for a family meeting - perhaps on   Mother's Day, Father's Day or the Friday after Thanksgiving -   when all the children are present, Long recommends. ""It's a good   way to get the conversation started and then you can do a   refresher or update down the road."" The first conversation should serve as a door-opener. There   are weighty decisions at play - which may change over time with   your parents' mental or physical health - so don't expect a   one-and-done conversation. 2. Begin with the basics Talking about money inspires reactions ranging from secretive   to forthright. Even if your parents aren't particularly prickly   about discussing their finances, it's prudent to ease into such   conversations. Long says a strategy that's ""very helpful"" is approaching   discussions from a group-planning perspective - sharing what   end-of-life goals you're considering and asking your parents   about theirs. ""Remember, these are subjects that a lot of older   folks hold close to their hearts,"" he says. Be sensitive when starting that initial conversation. Think   less interrogative (how much money's at stake and who gets what?)   and more collaborative (exchanging information about where   accounts are held or who has power of attorney). 3. Broach serious topics Once you've established a rapport, tackle topics that make   either you or your parents uncomfortable, including the morose   (funeral arrangements or declining health) and the dangerous   (financial scams targeting seniors that could wipe out their   savings). Don't let the prospect of an awkward conversation now create a   bigger headache in the future. Strive for this balance:   confronting reality head-on without infantilizing or offending   your parents. A bad way to deal? Shutting down future   conversations when talks are strained. A better way to deal?   Involving other family members to facilitate discussion or   working with a financial advisor to handle trickier topics. (Here   are some tips on   choosing a financial advisor    .) 4. Leave judgment at the door Conversations with your parents may reveal wildly different   opinions about how to handle finances. You're asking them to part   with sensitive information; promise a judgment-free zone in   return. Because of the prevalence of financial abuse - it's estimated   one in five elders have been impacted - urge your parents to flag   potential scams. Avoid shaming them for ill-advised financial   decisions or falling victim to fraud.

"Alarm bells rang for Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) investors last Friday when The Information reported that e-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) was considering selling cheap white-box networking hardware to third parties. Amazon entering a market should never be taken lightly, and Wall Street reacted by sending shares of Cisco and other networking stocks plunging.It was all much ado about nothing. Speaking to MarketWatch on Wednesday, a Cisco spokesman shot down the report: ""Cisco and AWS have a long-standing customer and partner relationship, and during a recent call between Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins and AWS CEO Andy Jassy, Andy confirmed that AWS is not actively building a commercial network switch."" An AWS spokeswoman later confirmed that statement.makeArticleAd();The Cisco Catalyst 9000 family of switches. Image source: Cisco Systems.What it meansI argued last week that Amazon would face an uphill battle stealing market share away from Cisco. Cisco controls more than 50% of the market for networking switches, even after fighting off low-priced challengers for years.Amazon was reportedly considering undercutting Cisco on price by as much as 80%, which sounds like a disruptive move. But Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins said back in July that companies often spend $15 on operating costs over five years for each dollar spent on networking equipment. The price of the equipment, then, is far less important than the ongoing costs of using that equipment. Any cost savings from a lower-priced switch can easily be swamped by higher operating costs.Cisco's latest line of switches, the Catalyst 9000 series, uses machine learning to reduce operating costs . When the company was testing the switches with large organizations last year, it cited an operating expense savings of 61% for those participants. That wasn't the only benefit -- Cisco also said that the impact of security breaches was reduced by 48%.Breaking into a market with entrenched players is not easy, even for Amazon. With AWS, the company had the benefit of a massive first-mover advantage. AWS was launched in 2006, years before cloud computing went mainstream. Not so with networking hardware. And with global switch sales growing slowly, it's not hard to see why Amazon would want to put its resources in other areas.While Amazon has no plans to sell networking equipment, it could be using cheap white-box hardware in its own data centers. Other large internet companies are doing the same, and I'd be surprised if Amazon hadn't already jumped on the bandwagon. But that doesn't pose much of a threat to Cisco.Cisco will be just fineEven if Amazon were to jump into the networking hardware business, I think Cisco would hold up well. The company has been shifting its business model to subscriptions, selling its Catalyst 9000 switches as part of a subscription package. This move seems to be resonating with its customers. The platform boasted 5,800 customers at the end of the fiscal third quarter, up from 3,100 at the end of the second quarter, and the vast majority of customers are choosing the most advanced subscription package. This bundling of hardware and software makes it even more daunting for a customer to drop Cisco for one of its competitors.Overall, Cisco is doing just fine. Revenue is growing, earnings are on the rise, and a massive $25 billion share buyback will be playing out over the next couple of years. With Amazon out of the picture, there's not much holding the stock back.10 stocks we like better than Cisco Systems   When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"    Alphabet's GOOGL  Google is looking at a 4.34 billion euro ($5 billion) fine for anticompetitive behavior in the EU. Google's alleged wrongdoing constitutes the leveraging of Android to unfairly promote its own search service with the compulsory pre-installation of its app bundle, exclusion of rival search and browser apps from pre-installation (it stopped excluding rival search in 2014), and assuring that its hardware partners don't make phones using Android forks. It will also have to pay up to 5% of average daily global revenue for non-compliance after the expiry of 90 days. During this time, it can either stop the three malpractices or request delayed implementation while it appeals. Google said it would appeal although it will transfer the amount of the fine to a separate account and provide for it from its $100 billion+ cash reserves. Google's defense remains that its strategy allows it to offer a free operating system to hardware makers and prevents fragmentation of Android, making it worthwhile for app makers to develop on the platform. It's also then more useful for consumers, since they get a device out of the box that just works. Moreover, it has facilitated the launch of more than 24,000 smart devices from more than 1,300 different brands, some at very low price points, indicating that many people/entities gained from Android.  The Question of Apple  The fragmentation argument may have made sense several years ago when device makers feared Apple AAPL  and its walled garden because it was the only place to go for quality. But today, Apple is barely a fifth of the market (albeit the best part) while Android is 4X its size. Since the competitive dynamics have changed, Apple dominating the high end of the market is less of a concern today than Android dominating everything else. As Vestager points out, iPhones aren't a sufficient check on Google's dominance because their price makes them more difficult to adopt. So ""what would serve competition is to have more players."" Google CEO Sundar Pichai's response was therefore not surprising: ""We are concerned that today's decision will upset the careful balance that we have struck with Android, and that it sends a troubling signal in favor of proprietary systems over open platforms.""  Not So Negative for Google  But the EU has left enough wiggle room for Google. It hasn't said that Google won't be able to outbid smaller search players to get pre-installed on devices or be set as the default. It also hasn't said that Google is obliged to provide its apps to devices built on Android forks (the app bundle includes 11 different apps, including Maps, Gmail and Docs, the EU is unbundling just Chrome and Search from Play). So devices built on Amazon's AMZN  Fire OS (for example) may have to make do without some of its services but will still have access to the Play Store. Since users are familiar with Google services, hardware makers are more likely to stick with them in most cases rather than experiment with something new (other than from a company like Amazon that is). There is also Pichai's veiled threat to consider: ""the Android business model has meant that we haven't had to charge phone makers for our technology, or depend on a tightly controlled distribution mode."" Telecoms may also choose to avoid distractions at a time when they are vying with each other to be the first to launch 5G services.  Why Google's Monopoly Is a Problem  Growing to be a monopoly on the strength of good products is not in itself illegal. But there are two situations when it can become a problem. The first is when it effectively raises prices and the second is when the dominant position is used as leverage to dominate another/adjacent market. Google and other technology companies that rely on data have risen to prominence on the back of solid products and because the government has taken a casual approach to their anticompetitive behavior. In a sense this was because unlike traditional monopolies, modern tech monopolies don't raise prices. Now that they are taking over even more of our lives, the government has started to take notice. But in order for a company to be adjudged abusive, it has to be shown that it resorted to unfair competitive behavior including the exclusion of other companies from the market. The courts have reportedly taken the view that this can be conclusively proved only when the dominating company has taken over at least 50% of the adjacent market using these tactics. This is hard to prove and difficult to reverse. So this is something that the legal system has to change if it wants to truly go after such behavior.  An Even Bigger Problem  The problem with Google being the dominant search engine is not just related to its own wrong doing, of which there is some evidence. It's also related to the way information is disseminated online. If Google becomes the sole gateway to information, its company policies, principles and values will determine the way the world consumes information, which is anything but healthy. Moreover, it becomes easier for anybody wanting to game the system to put fake news and other harmful stuff in circulation. At the end of the day, the company has too much data on us that we have not been able to quantify or price adequately. So we don't know what we have ""paid"" for Google's ""free"" services. Also, since this data isn't shared with the competition, they are incapable of improving their products or serving us equally well, thus further cementing Google's dominant position. The EU has taken some important first steps to break Google's monopoly, but it will probably require much more to bring in the kind of competition it envisages. If all else fails, the tech titans will have to be regulated like utilities. But that is a story for another day.     Recommendations  Alphabet shares carry a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

"Investors had a few   good reasons    to keep their expectations for   eBay    's (NASDAQ: EBAY) second-quarter results in check. Its sales   growth pace had badly trailed fully integrated e-commerce rivals   like   Amazon.com    (NASDAQ: AMZN) and   Walmart    (NYSE: WMT) , after all. And the online marketplace has announced   lower profitability due to the expensive investments management   is making in the business. eBay's recent earnings report didn't change the big-picture   narrative that paired market-share challenges with reduced profit   margins. Let's take a closer look.makeArticleAd();   Image source: Getty Images. Reduced growth rates The pool of active buyers expanded by 4% to mark no   improvement over the prior quarter's sluggish pace. Before the   past six months, eBay had been growing this core metric at a 5%   rate for over a year, but trends have worsened slightly,   especially in the U.S. segment. The slower expansion put pressure on the marketplace's sales   volumes, which rose at the slowest rate in nine months in the   U.S. market while just holding steady in the international   segment. eBay's overall volume ticked up by 7%, compared to 33%   sales gains achieved by Amazon and by Walmart's e-commerce   segment. eBay's unit sales slowed for the third straight quarter, too,   with the number of product sales holding flat, compared to a 1%   uptick in the prior quarter and a 2% increase in the holiday   quarter. Overall, these numbers show that the marketplace's   growth initiatives, including improvements to product pages and   other customer experience upgrades, haven't delivered faster   volume gains. Profitability pressures Meanwhile, eBay's transaction fees, its   main source of profits    , ticked down to 8.1% from 8.2% in the marketplace segment while   holding steady at 22.7% in the StubHub division. Expenses were a   bigger drag on earnings, though. Sales and marketing costs jumped   to 30.6% of sales from 28.9% and product development ate up 11.1%   of sales compared to 10.8% in the prior year. Combined, these cost boosts overwhelmed smaller savings in   other areas to push profitability lower as operating margin   dropped to 25.2% of sales from 26.4%. That result still kept eBay   far more profitable than its integrated retailing peers.   Walmart's operating margin was 4.2% last quarter, and Amazon's   comparable metric was 2.8%. Looking ahead In a press release detailing the results, CEO Devin Wenig and   his team stressed the fact that eBay made progress along its   goals this quarter, including by making it easier to buy and sell   products on its platform. ""We continued to execute our strategy,""   executives said, ""making improvements to the core eBay   experience."" The extra spending, meanwhile, was in service of   pursuing ""significant opportunities"" in areas like advertising   and payments, Wenig explained. Investors can look for the core business to speed up in the   second half of fiscal 2018, but the gains will be muted. In fact,   executives lowered their revenue outlook and now expect sales to   rise between 6% and 7%, down from the prior target range of   between 7% and 9%. Lower tax expenses imply that profits should   stop at between $2.28 per share and $2.32 per share, or a bit   higher than the prior forecast range. But eBay is now expecting   operating margin to fall to about 27%, the low end of its   guidance range, mainly due to extra costs associated with its   acquisition of a selling platform in Japan. These top- and bottom-line targets translate into continued   growth for the e-commerce giant, but at a slower pace than the   company enjoyed in fiscal 2017. Management had entered the year   hoping to achieve another period of accelerating growth, but   instead eBay might see steady, or slightly decreasing, sales   volume gains.   10 stocks we like better than eBay       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

"Will   Amazon.com    (NASDAQ: AMZN) shoppers soon be able to click ""Buy It Now"" on a   new car? And if so, what does that mean for online car-shopping   service   TrueCar    (NASDAQ: TRUE) ? The online retail giant isn't   quite    there, not yet. But Amazon Vehicles, a   new-car research portal    that was added to Amazon's giant site in 2016, just took a big   step in that direction with its first digital new-car showroom --   courtesy of   Hyundai    (NASDAQOTH: HYMTF) . Why Hyundai has a new Amazon ""showroom"" Hyundai said its   new   Amazon showroom    will allow shoppers to compare models, read reviews, view the   vehicles that local dealers have in inventory, and schedule test   drives.makeArticleAd();   The landing page for Hyundai's new ""showroom"" on Amazon.com.     Image source: Hyundai. A prospective customer will still have to work with a Hyundai   dealer to actually buy a car. The idea behind the Amazon portal   is that it will -- hopefully -- generate a flow of new traffic to   Hyundai's U.S. dealers, while helping the company stand out from   rival automakers in the minds of the Amazon customers who venture   into the Amazon Vehicles sub-site. The idea, said Tim Maxwell, Hyundai's U.S. digital marketing   manager, is to give customers a way to research and act on a   new-car purchase that is familiar and consistent with the overall   Amazon shopping experience. ""This collaboration with Amazon provides customers with the   ability to learn about Hyundai vehicles in a way that matches   their expectations for nearly every other type of purchase,""   Maxwell said. Is Amazon Vehicles now on a collision course with   TrueCar? Slowly but surely, Amazon has been building its Vehicles   portal into a serious rival to car-review-and-shopping sites like   Edmunds and Autotrader. The site already offers photos, detailed   specifications, and customer reviews for just about every vehicle   sold in the United States. The only thing that has been missing   is a direct way for Amazon customers to purchase a vehicle via   the site -- a ""buy it now"" button for new cars. Amazon has already tested the car-sales waters, in a small   way. It worked with   Fiat Chrysler Automobiles    (NYSE: FCAU) to offer 3 Fiat models at discounts to its customers   in Italy in 2016. But until now, Amazon didn't offer its   customers in the U.S. any way to take a direct step toward buying   a car. Hyundai's new showroom changes that, and that makes it a   significant step forward. Amazon is now in more or less direct   competition with online car-shopping site   TrueCar    (NASDAQ: TRUE) , at least with customers who want Hyundais. TrueCar was founded with the goal of taking much of the hassle   out of car-buying. The site works by matching serious   (""qualified"") buyers with nearby dealers that have agreed to   honor a no-haggle price. TrueCar has quite a head start on Amazon: As of the end of the   first quarter, it had   over 12,000 new-car dealers    signed up to take referrals from its service. TrueCar's users   purchased about 230,000 vehicles via the service in the first   quarter. That's a big number, but it's one that could be dwarfed   in a hurry if Amazon got serious about inserting itself into the   car-buying process. Will it? There is some money to be made here. TrueCar collects   referral fees from its dealer partners after cars are sold. Those   fees averaged $334 per car in the first quarter, generating   nearly $77 million in revenue for TrueCar. One could easily imagine Amazon doing an end run around   TrueCar's dealer relationships by reaching out to   automakers,    offering to send their dealers referrals in exchange for the   lowest possible no-haggle price. Dealers might protest that   signing up with Amazon could squeeze their already-thin margins   -- but in the end, I suspect Amazon's scale and reach would make   it very hard for them to refuse. That wouldn't be great news for those new-car dealers. It   would almost certainly be devastating news for TrueCar.   Image source: Hyundai. What is Amazon's likely play, here? Given that Amazon Vehicles has been up and running for nearly   two years, and this is its first automaker showroom, it's safe to   say that the company hasn't exactly rushed into the new-car   space. It's clearly toying with the idea of doing so, though. I suspect Amazon's leadership is very aware that most   Americans dislike the experience of buying a new car. There is   probably a very big opportunity for the company to insert itself   as the middleman in this unpopular process, streamlining it for   both buyers and dealers -- and not, incidentally, taking a cut   for itself. If nothing else, the new Hyundai showroom will give Amazon a   chance to get answers to some big questions: How much can it ask   for such a service, and how much would it cost to provide? I think if Amazon decides it can earn a decent profit in this   space, we'll see more automakers sign up to create virtual   showrooms on Amazon's retail platform. If so, that will put   TrueCar in a very tough spot. Stay tuned.   10 stocks we like better than Amazon       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

"    Shares of Costco COST  climbed to another new all-time high Thursday as investors show their love for the warehouse-style grocery chain amid nearly constant headlines about Amazon's AMZN  industry takeover. Meanwhile, Target TGT  stock also surged to inch close to its 52-week high. So let's see which stock looks better at the moment.  Industry Overview  Some worried that Amazon's June 2017 purchase of Whole Foods would crush the traditional grocery world. Yet, today we are far away  from an Amazon-dominated retail industry, much less a Jeff Bezos-controlled grocery market. Plus, consumers around the U.S. are likely far better off based on Amazon's continued push into retail, grocery, and delivery because it has forced companies to innovate. Giants from Walmart WMT  to Kroger KR  have jumped headfirst into delivery, online ordering, and much more. But Target and Costco have been two of the more successful grocery and discount retailers over the last year.   Innovation    Last quarter, Target introduced its online ordering and curbside pickup service called ""Drive-Up"" at more than 250 stores, expanded its ""Restock"" program-which allows customers to shop from thousands of popular items online for next day delivery-nationwide, and introduced same-day delivery from more than 700 stores. Target was able to bolster its new-age offerings through its $550 million purchase of grocery delivery startup Shipt. The Minneapolis-based retailer saw its digital sales surge 28% in Q1, on top of a 21% climb in the year-ago period. Costco launched two-day delivery for non-perishable food and household supplies nationwide last fall. The company also expanded its same-day delivery service to ""most metropolitan"" areas through an updated partnership with Instacart.  Stock Movement  Now let's take a look at how COST and TGT stock have performed. Shares of Costco are up roughly 85% over the last five years, which outpaces the S&P 500's 70% climb. Target, on the other hand, is up just around 8% during this time period. However, more recently, investors can see that Target and Costco are neck and neck and both crush the S&P's 14% jump.       Valuation  Moving on, the two stocks present far different valuation pictures. Target stock is currently trading at 14.3X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which marks a discount compared to the S&P's 17.4X and its industry's 18.7X. TGT stock is also trading below its year-long high of 16.9X and not too far above its one-year median of 13.6X. Meanwhile, COST is trading just below its year-long high at 28.5X and above its low of 23.6X. Clearly, some investors see a reason to pay a significant premium compared to the industry average for COST. Furthermore, Target stock presents solid value compared to where it has traded at over the last decade, while COST sits near its 10-year high.       Outlook  Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Target's adjusted quarterly earnings to climb by 13%, with its full-year EPS figure projected to climb by 12% to hit $5.28. The company's Q2 revenues are projected to reach $17.3 billion, which would mark 5.3% growth. For the full-year, Target's revenues are expected to expand by just 2.3% to touch $73.52 billion. Costco, which reported its fiscal third-quarter results at the very end of May, is expected to see its Q4 revenues climb by over 2% to $43.2 billion, with full-year revenues projected to climb nearly 9% to $140.51 billion. Moving to the other end of the income statement, COST is projected to see its fourth-quarter earnings pop by 10%. Its fiscal 2018 earnings are expected to reach $7.05 per share, which would mark a 21% surge.  Bottom Line  Target has earned six upward earnings estimate revisions for its second quarter, with 100% agreement to the upside, over the last 60 days. Meanwhile, COST has received three upward changes against zero downward revisions for its current quarter, within the last 30 days. Target and Costco are currently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stocks and sport ""A"" VGM scores. Clearly, both stocks have their appeal, and both companies look ready to compete in the modern retail age. But Target stock offers investors much better value at the moment.  Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies   makeArticleAd();  It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

"Reuters  @media screen and (max-device-width: 480px){body{ font-size:30pt !important;}}    By Anna Irrera and Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi NEW YORK/ZURICH, July 19 (Reuters) - Swiss regulators are stepping up efforts to halt an exodus of cryptocurrency projects from the country, after two of only a handful of banks active in the nascent sector shut their doors on it in the last year. The departures, which industry sources fear will continue, mean Switzerland is losing business to offshore rivals including Liechtenstein, Gibraltar and the Cayman Islands, where banks are more welcoming.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','',''); The wealthy Swiss canton of Zug, for example, has been dubbed ""Crypto Valley"", with 200-300 virtual currency entities opening there in recent years. Zug's finance director, Heinz Taennler, says they may leave if the government does not take steps to give them access to the banking system, without which they struggle to function. ""All their banking relationships are going to Liechtenstein,"" he told Reuters. ""These are hundreds of jobs that have been created, and every job is important."" Thomas Moser, an alternate member of the governing board at the Swiss National Bank (SNB), said some cryptocurrency companies had asked the central to intervene. ""They raised concerns about problems with opening bank accounts, which was a worry for them, and asked for help,"" Moser told Reuters. ""I said this was not something the SNB dealt with, but they should speak with FINMA. FINMA, Switzerland's financial market supervisor, has held discussions with the SNB and bankers' association on how to make banks more accessible to cryptocurrency ventures. ""We would not want to close the door on the opportunities that such innovation (cryptocurrencies) might bring,"" Moser added. Providing the legal framework to launch ICOs and for banks to do business with cryptocurrency companies is not easy. The risk of fraud and lack of transparency about who owns cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether have made regulators around the world wary. The United States is among countries that are increasing scrutiny of the sector.   BANKS WARY Swiss banks are urging the authorities to give them more clarity on the rules that apply to cryptocurrency projects before providing services to the market, and at least two important players have withdrawn for now. Zuercher Kantonalbank (ZKB), the fourth largest Swiss bank and one of the few big banks in the world to welcome issuers of cryptocurrencies, has closed the accounts of more than 20 companies in the last year, industry sources told Reuters. A spokesman for ZKB declined to comment on any former or existing clients relationships, but said the bank does not do business with any cryptocurrency groups. Another large Swiss bank kicked out crypto project Smart Valor at around the same time, said a person familiar with the project. The source declined to name the bank. Only a handful of Switzerland's 250 banks ever allowed companies to deposit the cash equivalent of cryptocurrencies raised in ICOs. At least two still do, Reuters has established. But the involvement of a large bank like ZKB helped to establish Switzerland as an early cryptocurrency hub. ZKB and the bank that turned its back on Smart Valor began shutting their doors in October after a management feud severely damaged cryptocurrency project Tezos, which had conducted Zug's largest ICO, entrepreneurs and advisers said.  Swiss banks are worried because some companies that carried out ICOs did not do anti-money laundering (AML) checks on their contributors, industry sources said. This means the banks themselves could fall foul of AML rules.   LIECHTENSTEIN A WINNER ""A cautionary response from Swiss banks resulted in a pause or closure for most projects in the cryptocurrency space,""  said David Henderson, founder of the Swiss Sweetbridge Foundation, set up to conduct blockchain startup Sweetbridge's ICO. Sweetbridge was in the late stages of securing an account with ZKB, but the application was put on hold a few days after the Tezos scandal erupted, Henderson said. The project ultimately decided not to carry out its planned ICO through the Swiss foundation, setting up entities and bank accounts in Gibraltar and Liechtenstein instead. It is difficult for crypto-projects to use the funds they raise through ICOs if they are locked out of the banking system. Funds from ICOs are often originally raised in cryptocurrencies bitcoin and ether, which have limited use as a means of payment in the broader economy. ""I cannot pay salaries because our money is caught up there. We cannot move it,"" said the founder of a Swiss crypto-firm which has had accounts closed at three different banks. The banks have asked the firm to take out its money, but it is unable to do so without first finding another banking relationship, the founder added. At least two Swiss banks are still accepting ICO funds, according to checks by Reuters. These are Banca Zarattini, a small bank in the Italian-language canton Ticino, and Hypothekarbank Lenzburg, a regional lender located between Zurich and Basel, which recently began accepting crypto customers. Banca Zarattini only banks ICO companies with KYC (know-your-customer) and AML procedures that are in compliance with Swiss law, it said. Hypothekarbank Lenzburg said it had started to accept crytocurrency companies and could charge an initial assessment fee of up to 2,500 Swiss francs($2,500). Bank Frick in Liechtenstein has become a popular alternative for Swiss entities struggling to secure accounts. It banks around 160 crypto-enterprises or projects, of which 60 are in the process of setting up an ICO, the bank told Reuters. The bank, however, declined 90 percent of account requests from cryptocurrency companies and only accepts ICOs based onshore in Switzerland or Liechtenstein, it said.   RULES AND REASSURANCES Despite the challenges, Switzerland is working on new rules to reassure banks and encourage them to accept the accounts of cryptocurrency companies. The country has dropped from second place in 2017 to sixth this year in a country ranking of the sum of ICO funds raised,  according to a study published by PwC and the Crypto Valley Association in June. The Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands topped the list. In May, Swiss Finance Minister Ueli Maurer invited FINMA, the central bank and the Swiss Bankers Association (SBA) to a roundtable discussion on bank accounts for cryptocurrencies. After the meeting, the SBA set up a working group to compile a set of checks and conditions that all banks could follow when opening an account for cryptocurrency firms. ""Banks are currently hesitant to open business accounts for companies with particular touchpoints to ICOs and cryptocurrencies - due to risks such as fraud or money laundering,"" SBA said in a statement. Zug finance director Taennler said the aim set out during the meeting, which he attended, was to have a set of FINMA-approved guidelines for assessing prospective cryptocurrency clients by the year-end. FINMA has already issued separate guidelines to spell out how Swiss AML rules and securities regulations apply to various ICOs. But securities rules are less stringent in Switzerland than in the United States, where the Securities and Exchange Commission has toughened its stance on ICOs.  This makes it more risky for banks in Switzerland to be involved with ICO projects which may have raised money from U.S. contributors and could fall under the purview of the SEC. Switzerland's authorities have said they want to create conditions for the country to remain competitive but with no room for scams or financial crime. The finance ministry is also looking at the broader legal framework for blockchain technology and ICOs. Its findings will be presented to the federal government by the end of the year and will determine how the technology fits into existing Swiss laws and regulations.

"Reuters  @media screen and (max-device-width: 480px){body{ font-size:30pt !important;}}    By Anna Irrera and Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi NEW YORK/ZURICH, July 19 (Reuters) - Swiss regulators are stepping up efforts to halt an exodus of cryptocurrency projects from the country, after two of only a handful of banks active in the nascent sector shut their doors on it in the last year. The departures, which industry sources fear will continue, mean Switzerland is losing business to offshore rivals including Liechtenstein, Gibraltar and the Cayman Islands, where banks are more welcoming.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','',''); The wealthy Swiss canton of Zug, for example, has been dubbed ""Crypto Valley"", with 200-300 virtual currency entities opening there in recent years. Zug's finance director, Heinz Taennler, says they may leave if the government does not take steps to give them access to the banking system, without which they struggle to function. ""All their banking relationships are going to Liechtenstein,"" he told Reuters. ""These are hundreds of jobs that have been created, and every job is important."" Thomas Moser, an alternate member of the governing board at the Swiss National Bank (SNB), said some cryptocurrency companies had asked the central to intervene. ""They raised concerns about problems with opening bank accounts, which was a worry for them, and asked for help,"" Moser told Reuters. ""I said this was not something the SNB dealt with, but they should speak with FINMA. FINMA, Switzerland's financial market supervisor, has held discussions with the SNB and bankers' association on how to make banks more accessible to cryptocurrency ventures. ""We would not want to close the door on the opportunities that such innovation (cryptocurrencies) might bring,"" Moser added. Providing the legal framework to launch ICOs and for banks to do business with cryptocurrency companies is not easy. The risk of fraud and lack of transparency about who owns cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether have made regulators around the world wary. The United States is among countries that are increasing scrutiny of the sector.   BANKS WARY Swiss banks are urging the authorities to give them more clarity on the rules that apply to cryptocurrency projects before providing services to the market, and at least two important players have withdrawn for now. Zuercher Kantonalbank (ZKB), the fourth largest Swiss bank and one of the few big banks in the world to welcome issuers of cryptocurrencies, has closed the accounts of more than 20 companies in the last year, industry sources told Reuters. A spokesman for ZKB declined to comment on any former or existing clients relationships, but said the bank does not do business with any cryptocurrency groups. Another large Swiss bank kicked out crypto project Smart Valor at around the same time, said a person familiar with the project. The source declined to name the bank. Only a handful of Switzerland's 250 banks ever allowed companies to deposit the cash equivalent of cryptocurrencies raised in ICOs. At least two still do, Reuters has established. But the involvement of a large bank like ZKB helped to establish Switzerland as an early cryptocurrency hub. ZKB and the bank that turned its back on Smart Valor began shutting their doors in October after a management feud severely damaged cryptocurrency project Tezos, which had conducted Zug's largest ICO, entrepreneurs and advisers said.

"    When you were a young'un, your parents may have sat you down   to talk about the ""birds and the bees."" Now it's time to turn the   tables and address another uncomfortable topic: their   finances. Such conversations mark a reversal in the traditional   parent-child dynamic, and also can be fraught with concerns over   independence, trust and mortality. As a result, these talks often   don't happen at all, and a perceived lack of urgency is to blame,   according to a 2018 survey conducted by Wells Fargo. Roughly one-third of parents over the age of 60 say they've   never discussed later-life needs with family, including   inheritance plans, beneficiaries, important documents or   designated representatives, according to the survey. Meanwhile,   adult children worry such conversations will cause conflict or   make it seem as though they're after their parents' money.makeArticleAd(); As daunting as it may seem, it's important to have ""the talk""   about finances with your parents to help protect them from scams   and elder abuse, which cost Americans more than $36 billion each   year, according to financial services firm True Link Financial.   These conversations also ensure that a rapid-response plan is in   place in the event of disability and that there are no surprises   after your parents die, says Ron Long, head of regulatory affairs   and elder client initiatives at Wells Fargo Advisors. These four tips can open lines of communication. 1. Start with one conversation When's a good time to sit your parents down for a hard   conversation about their financial well-being, plans for the   future and important legal and financial documents like a will,   power of attorney or health care directives? The twelfth of   never, for most children. Don't wait for tragedy to strike. A study by Ameriprise   Financial found that a life-altering incident was the trigger for   90% of children who'd actually discussed estate planning with   their parents.  » Unfamiliar with estate planning?     See our   7-step checklist  Instead, carve out time for a family meeting - perhaps on   Mother's Day, Father's Day or the Friday after Thanksgiving -   when all the children are present, Long recommends. ""It's a good   way to get the conversation started and then you can do a   refresher or update down the road."" The first conversation should serve as a door-opener. There   are weighty decisions at play - which may change over time with   your parents' mental or physical health - so don't expect a   one-and-done conversation. 2. Begin with the basics Talking about money inspires reactions ranging from secretive   to forthright. Even if your parents aren't particularly prickly   about discussing their finances, it's prudent to ease into such   conversations. Long says a strategy that's ""very helpful"" is approaching   discussions from a group-planning perspective - sharing what   end-of-life goals you're considering and asking your parents   about theirs. ""Remember, these are subjects that a lot of older   folks hold close to their hearts,"" he says. Be sensitive when starting that initial conversation. Think   less interrogative (how much money's at stake and who gets what?)   and more collaborative (exchanging information about where   accounts are held or who has power of attorney). 3. Broach serious topics Once you've established a rapport, tackle topics that make   either you or your parents uncomfortable, including the morose   (funeral arrangements or declining health) and the dangerous   (financial scams targeting seniors that could wipe out their   savings). Don't let the prospect of an awkward conversation now create a   bigger headache in the future. Strive for this balance:   confronting reality head-on without infantilizing or offending   your parents. A bad way to deal? Shutting down future   conversations when talks are strained. A better way to deal?   Involving other family members to facilitate discussion or   working with a financial advisor to handle trickier topics.

Because of the prevalence of financial abuse - it's estimated   one in five elders have been impacted - urge your parents to flag   potential scams.

""If this ends up being a protracted war, it's going to be bad news,"" said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco. ""Unless this thing starts to show significant progress prior to the midterms, it's going to be a black mark, because the economy will start to slow down,"" he said, referring to congressional elections on Nov. 6. Shares of eBay  dropped 10.1 percent after a disappointing earnings report.  The stock was among the biggest drags on the Nasdaq and the S&P 500. American Express Co  dipped 2.7 percent after the credit card company reported rising expenses due to increased spending on its rewards program.  The dollar index  briefly hit a one-year high, reinforcing worries that the strong greenback could hurt results from U.S. multinationals. But the dollar pared gains after President Donald Trump expressed concern about a strong currency.

The second-quarter reporting period is gaining momentum, with results in so far from 69 companies in the S&P 500.

Of the companies that have reported, 85.5 percent have surprised analyst estimates to the upside, according to Thomson Reuters data. The financial sector  saw the biggest percentage drop in the S&P 500, down 1.4 percent.

The U.S. yield curve flattened close to levels not seen in 11 years on upbeat economic data, dragging on banks.  JPMorgan, Bank of America  and Citigroup  were all down more than 1 percent. Bank of New York Mellon  fell 5.2 percent after saying the loss of two clients will continue to hurt results, while Travelers Cos  was among the biggest drags on the Dow Jones, falling 3.7 percent following a profit miss attributed to U.S. storm-related losses.

"Reuters  @media screen and (max-device-width: 480px){body{ font-size:30pt !important;}}    By Anna Irrera and Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi NEW YORK/ZURICH, July 19 (Reuters) - Swiss regulators are stepping up efforts to halt an exodus of cryptocurrency projects from the country, after two of only a handful of banks active in the nascent sector shut their doors on it in the last year. The departures, which industry sources fear will continue, mean Switzerland is losing business to offshore rivals including Liechtenstein, Gibraltar and the Cayman Islands, where banks are more welcoming.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','',''); The wealthy Swiss canton of Zug, for example, has been dubbed ""Crypto Valley"", with 200-300 virtual currency entities opening there in recent years. Zug's finance director, Heinz Taennler, says they may leave if the government does not take steps to give them access to the banking system, without which they struggle to function. ""All their banking relationships are going to Liechtenstein,"" he told Reuters. ""These are hundreds of jobs that have been created, and every job is important."" Thomas Moser, an alternate member of the governing board at the Swiss National Bank (SNB), said some cryptocurrency companies had asked the central to intervene. ""They raised concerns about problems with opening bank accounts, which was a worry for them, and asked for help,"" Moser told Reuters. ""I said this was not something the SNB dealt with, but they should speak with FINMA. FINMA, Switzerland's financial market supervisor, has held discussions with the SNB and bankers' association on how to make banks more accessible to cryptocurrency ventures. ""We would not want to close the door on the opportunities that such innovation (cryptocurrencies) might bring,"" Moser added. Providing the legal framework to launch ICOs and for banks to do business with cryptocurrency companies is not easy. The risk of fraud and lack of transparency about who owns cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether have made regulators around the world wary. The United States is among countries that are increasing scrutiny of the sector.   BANKS WARY Swiss banks are urging the authorities to give them more clarity on the rules that apply to cryptocurrency projects before providing services to the market, and at least two important players have withdrawn for now. Zuercher Kantonalbank (ZKB), the fourth largest Swiss bank and one of the few big banks in the world to welcome issuers of cryptocurrencies, has closed the accounts of more than 20 companies in the last year, industry sources told Reuters. A spokesman for ZKB declined to comment on any former or existing clients relationships, but said the bank does not do business with any cryptocurrency groups. Another large Swiss bank kicked out crypto project Smart Valor at around the same time, said a person familiar with the project. The source declined to name the bank. Only a handful of Switzerland's 250 banks ever allowed companies to deposit the cash equivalent of cryptocurrencies raised in ICOs. At least two still do, Reuters has established. But the involvement of a large bank like ZKB helped to establish Switzerland as an early cryptocurrency hub. ZKB and the bank that turned its back on Smart Valor began shutting their doors in October after a management feud severely damaged cryptocurrency project Tezos, which had conducted Zug's largest ICO, entrepreneurs and advisers said.  Swiss banks are worried because some companies that carried out ICOs did not do anti-money laundering (AML) checks on their contributors, industry sources said. This means the banks themselves could fall foul of AML rules.   LIECHTENSTEIN A WINNER ""A cautionary response from Swiss banks resulted in a pause or closure for most projects in the cryptocurrency space,""  said David Henderson, founder of the Swiss Sweetbridge Foundation, set up to conduct blockchain startup Sweetbridge's ICO. Sweetbridge was in the late stages of securing an account with ZKB, but the application was put on hold a few days after the Tezos scandal erupted, Henderson said. The project ultimately decided not to carry out its planned ICO through the Swiss foundation, setting up entities and bank accounts in Gibraltar and Liechtenstein instead. It is difficult for crypto-projects to use the funds they raise through ICOs if they are locked out of the banking system. Funds from ICOs are often originally raised in cryptocurrencies bitcoin and ether, which have limited use as a means of payment in the broader economy. ""I cannot pay salaries because our money is caught up there. We cannot move it,"" said the founder of a Swiss crypto-firm which has had accounts closed at three different banks. The banks have asked the firm to take out its money, but it is unable to do so without first finding another banking relationship, the founder added. At least two Swiss banks are still accepting ICO funds, according to checks by Reuters. These are Banca Zarattini, a small bank in the Italian-language canton Ticino, and Hypothekarbank Lenzburg, a regional lender located between Zurich and Basel, which recently began accepting crypto customers. Banca Zarattini only banks ICO companies with KYC (know-your-customer) and AML procedures that are in compliance with Swiss law, it said. Hypothekarbank Lenzburg said it had started to accept crytocurrency companies and could charge an initial assessment fee of up to 2,500 Swiss francs($2,500). Bank Frick in Liechtenstein has become a popular alternative for Swiss entities struggling to secure accounts. It banks around 160 crypto-enterprises or projects, of which 60 are in the process of setting up an ICO, the bank told Reuters. The bank, however, declined 90 percent of account requests from cryptocurrency companies and only accepts ICOs based onshore in Switzerland or Liechtenstein, it said.   RULES AND REASSURANCES Despite the challenges, Switzerland is working on new rules to reassure banks and encourage them to accept the accounts of cryptocurrency companies. The country has dropped from second place in 2017 to sixth this year in a country ranking of the sum of ICO funds raised,  according to a study published by PwC and the Crypto Valley Association in June. The Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands topped the list. In May, Swiss Finance Minister Ueli Maurer invited FINMA, the central bank and the Swiss Bankers Association (SBA) to a roundtable discussion on bank accounts for cryptocurrencies. After the meeting, the SBA set up a working group to compile a set of checks and conditions that all banks could follow when opening an account for cryptocurrency firms. ""Banks are currently hesitant to open business accounts for companies with particular touchpoints to ICOs and cryptocurrencies - due to risks such as fraud or money laundering,"" SBA said in a statement. Zug finance director Taennler said the aim set out during the meeting, which he attended, was to have a set of FINMA-approved guidelines for assessing prospective cryptocurrency clients by the year-end. FINMA has already issued separate guidelines to spell out how Swiss AML rules and securities regulations apply to various ICOs. But securities rules are less stringent in Switzerland than in the United States, where the Securities and Exchange Commission has toughened its stance on ICOs.  This makes it more risky for banks in Switzerland to be involved with ICO projects which may have raised money from U.S. contributors and could fall under the purview of the SEC. Switzerland's authorities have said they want to create conditions for the country to remain competitive but with no room for scams or financial crime. The finance ministry is also looking at the broader legal framework for blockchain technology and ICOs. Its findings will be presented to the federal government by the end of the year and will determine how the technology fits into existing Swiss laws and regulations.

"    When you were a young'un, your parents may have sat you down   to talk about the ""birds and the bees."" Now it's time to turn the   tables and address another uncomfortable topic: their   finances. Such conversations mark a reversal in the traditional   parent-child dynamic, and also can be fraught with concerns over   independence, trust and mortality. As a result, these talks often   don't happen at all, and a perceived lack of urgency is to blame,   according to a 2018 survey conducted by Wells Fargo. Roughly one-third of parents over the age of 60 say they've   never discussed later-life needs with family, including   inheritance plans, beneficiaries, important documents or   designated representatives, according to the survey. Meanwhile,   adult children worry such conversations will cause conflict or   make it seem as though they're after their parents' money.makeArticleAd(); As daunting as it may seem, it's important to have ""the talk""   about finances with your parents to help protect them from scams   and elder abuse, which cost Americans more than $36 billion each   year, according to financial services firm True Link Financial.   These conversations also ensure that a rapid-response plan is in   place in the event of disability and that there are no surprises   after your parents die, says Ron Long, head of regulatory affairs   and elder client initiatives at Wells Fargo Advisors. These four tips can open lines of communication. 1. Start with one conversation When's a good time to sit your parents down for a hard   conversation about their financial well-being, plans for the   future and important legal and financial documents like a will,   power of attorney or health care directives? The twelfth of   never, for most children. Don't wait for tragedy to strike. A study by Ameriprise   Financial found that a life-altering incident was the trigger for   90% of children who'd actually discussed estate planning with   their parents.  » Unfamiliar with estate planning?     See our   7-step checklist  Instead, carve out time for a family meeting - perhaps on   Mother's Day, Father's Day or the Friday after Thanksgiving -   when all the children are present, Long recommends. ""It's a good   way to get the conversation started and then you can do a   refresher or update down the road."" The first conversation should serve as a door-opener. There   are weighty decisions at play - which may change over time with   your parents' mental or physical health - so don't expect a   one-and-done conversation. 2. Begin with the basics Talking about money inspires reactions ranging from secretive   to forthright. Even if your parents aren't particularly prickly   about discussing their finances, it's prudent to ease into such   conversations. Long says a strategy that's ""very helpful"" is approaching   discussions from a group-planning perspective - sharing what   end-of-life goals you're considering and asking your parents   about theirs. ""Remember, these are subjects that a lot of older   folks hold close to their hearts,"" he says. Be sensitive when starting that initial conversation. Think   less interrogative (how much money's at stake and who gets what?)   and more collaborative (exchanging information about where   accounts are held or who has power of attorney). 3. Broach serious topics Once you've established a rapport, tackle topics that make   either you or your parents uncomfortable, including the morose   (funeral arrangements or declining health) and the dangerous   (financial scams targeting seniors that could wipe out their   savings). Don't let the prospect of an awkward conversation now create a   bigger headache in the future. Strive for this balance:   confronting reality head-on without infantilizing or offending   your parents. A bad way to deal? Shutting down future   conversations when talks are strained. A better way to deal?   Involving other family members to facilitate discussion or   working with a financial advisor to handle trickier topics.

"   makeZacksArticleAd();Though Trump's protectionist stance and the resultant trade tension has been playing foul on the stock market, American stocks have been showing momentum lately with the S&P 500 index climbing to the highest level in more than five months. The impressive run has been credited to robust earnings and strengthening economy.   This is especially true as Q2 earnings from about 10% companies on the S&P 500 that have reported so far are up 23% on 10% higher revenues. The proportion of these companies beating EPS and revenue estimates is tracking above other recent periods. As a whole, earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to grow 20.4% from the same period last year on 8.3% higher revenues. This would be the third consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth, a trend that is currently expected to continue in the second half of the year. A strong economy and historic tax cuts will continue to drive earnings higher.   Additionally, the Fed Chairman's testimony, which reaffirmed the central bank's plans to gradually increase interest rates, added to the strength. Powell painted an optimistic view of the economy, citing that America is expanding at a faster pace. Robust job gains, rise in income and optimism among households have lifted consumer spending in recent months and will likely continue doing so. Unemployment rate is below 4% and inflation is running above the Fed's 2% target for the first time in several years.   All these developments are strong enough to justify continued interest rate increases. The Fed has raised rates twice this year in quarter-point increments and is expected to implement two more lift-offs by the end of this year.   While there are winners from various corners of the space, we have highlighted stocks that have shown strong momentum over the past five months and have a solid Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

"     For Immediate Release  Chicago, IL - July 18, 2018 - Zacks Equity Research  highlights NetApp NTAP  as the Bull of the Day, PriceSmart PSMT  as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis onSuncor Energy SU  , Pioneer Natural Resources PXD  and Apache Corp. APA  . Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:   Bull of the Day   : Founded in April 1992 and headquartered in Sunnyvale, CA, NetApp provides enterprise storage and data management software and hardware products and services. The company offers cloud data services, data storage software, data backup and recovery, all-flash storage, converged systems, data infrastructure management, and hybrid flash storage.  Strong Results  The company reported strong results for its fiscal fourth-quarter 2018 ended April 27, 2018. Non-GAAP earnings of 1.05 per share were ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.01 per share. Earning surged 22.1% year-over-year and were also above the management's guidance. Revenues were up 11% from the year-ago quarter, and also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. ""The fourth quarter marked a great finish to a strong year. We successfully pivoted to the growth areas of the market, expanded our opportunity with HCI and new cloud partnerships, and improved operational discipline to deliver sustained and profitable growth,"" said the CEO.  Rising Estimates  After a strong quarterly report, analysts have significantly raised their estimates for the company. Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current and the next fiscal year have increased to $4.06 per share and $4.75 per share respectively, from $3.97 per share and $4.62 per share, before the results.   Returning Cash to Shareholders  During fiscal year 2018, the company returned $3.97 million to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends. It amounted to 76% of free cash flow. Earlier, the company announced that it will double its quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share in Q1 of FY 2019. The quarterly dividend will be paid on July 25, 2018.  Bottom Line  The stock is up almost 50% this year, but trading at about 20 times forward earnings, it does not look too expensive and with expected EPS growth rate of 13.84%, it can continue its upward trend. In this data driven economy, the demand for its products may continue to rise. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). It has Zacks Style Scores of ""A"" for Growth, ""B"" for Momentum and a VGM Score of ""B.""  Bear of the Day  : Founded in 1994 and headquartered in San Diego, CA, PriceSmart is the largest operator of membership warehouse clubs in Central America and the Caribbean. It has recently entered the South American region with clubs in Colombia. The company operates 40 warehouse clubs in 12 countries and one U.S. territory.  Disappointing Quarterly Results  The company reported quarterly earnings of 61 cents a share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 69 cents. Cost of goods sold and SG&A expenses went up during the quarter. This was the fourth miss for the company in the trailing five quarters. Total revenues were however up 7.1% and ahead of estimates. Shares plunged almost 8% in the after-market trading. Also, the company reported soft comparable warehouse sales performance for the month of June, further worrying investors about its outlook.  Estimates Slashed  Analysts have slashed their estimates significantly after poor results. Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current and next year are down to $3.01 per share and $3.20 per share respectively, down from $3.20 and $3.67, before the results.  The Bottom Line  Shares of this warehouse operator are down more than 10% this year but the outlook remains cloudy with consecutive misses and soft comps. The industry rank is in the bottom 20% and increases the likelihood of continued underpeformance.  Additional content:    5 Geopolitical Factors Which Have Affected Oil Prices in     2018   This year,  oil prices  have been spiking and hitting prices which have not been seen since 2014. However, thanks to more recent news, the continuous rally finally seems to have come to a slow halt. Last Wednesday, with the announcement that Libya's state-run National Oil Corp. is resuming full production of oil, oil prices plunged. Though prices seemed to rise again on Friday due to mixed signals and uncertainties, along with the latest trade threats, oil prices slid again today. There has also speculation on the possibility that Russia might commit to increasing its oil production to contribute to the global oil supply, which also affected the slide. However, this slump is very recent. For the last couple of months, oil has been trending upward, due to a number of international factors. Let's take a closer look at some of the main geopolitical events in the last couple months that affected the price of oil:  1. Venezuela's Falling Oil Production   With Venezuela's hyperinflation plaguing the welfare of the people, the country's crude production has also been going on a downward spiral. In fact, Venezuela's crude production has been falling for the last 25 months, according to the numbers shown by OPEC. Venezuela now produces almost half of the oil it did two decades ago. Venezuela's oil company, PDVSA, used to be the main source of foreign income for the government during the height of its days. Now, due to a lack of investment and maintenance, its future seems bleak. Without any signs of a turnaround, it can be expected that Venezuela's oil export will continue to drop. This crisis has lowered the global oil supply, lifting the price of the commodity higher.  2. U.S. Sanctions on Oil Imports from Iran  On May 8, President Donald Trump declared that, as a part of the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, it will impose sanctions on the OPEC member and world's fifth biggest oil producer. Many analysts immediately reacted adversely, claiming that withdrawing from the Iranian deal was indirectly supporting higher oil prices. Then, on June 26, the State Department got more direct, saying that it expects all countries to eliminate Iranian oil import to zero-or else they will face their own U.S. sanctions. Though the sanctions are for diplomatic reasons, such actions will inevitably show adverse effects on the global oil market and drive prices even higher.  3. OPEC's and Russia's Not-So-Promising Promise  On June 22, OPEC and Russia reached an agreement in Vienna to increase oil production by up to 1 million barrels a day. However, the meeting was generally very ambiguous, and specifics about which nations will pump how much were left out. Furthermore, the increase in number of barrels was not as much as people had anticipated. So, ironically, this meeting to ease the spike actually caused oil prices to rally after its conclusion.    Four days later, the kingpin of OPEC, Saudi Arabia, said it plans to pump a record-high 11 million barrels of oil in July. However, even with Saudi Arabia's promise, there is still not enough oil to fully replace the plunging inventory from Venezuela and Iran.  4. Power Outage in Canada  This past June, Canada's oil production struggled due to a power outage that shut down the Syncrude facility in Alberta. At the time, the company reported that it will not be ready to begin producing again until July. Last week, Canada-based Suncor Energy indicated that the Syncrude project would be returning to full production by September.  5. Dropping Inventory Levels from America  Although U.S. is producing record amounts of oil thanks to the Permian Basin in West Texas, the country still has its limits. Due to ever-high demand, which has seemingly exceeded supply, coupled with employee and supply shortages at the Permian Basin, the Energy Department said oil inventory decreased by 9.9 million barrels in the third week of June. Some Permian Basin producers to watch include Pioneer Natural Resources and Apache Corp.  Bottom Line  As a result of these five separate, yet inter-related events from all around the globe, oil supply has been plunging, which naturally led to the high prices we see now. Oil prices remain very volatile, as we can see from the past week's action. However, with Libya's plan of going full power mode again and Russia's possibility of cooperation, it seems as if there is a possibility, for the first time in a while, for oil prices to decrease at a constant level. Regardless, due to the volatile nature of oil prices, especially with so many factors contributing to its end, prices should continue to be followed closely.

"    The John Hancock Multifactor Mid Cap ETF (JHMM) was launched on 09/28/2015, and is a passively managed exchange traded fund designed to offer broad exposure to the Mid Cap Blend segment of the US equity market. The fund is sponsored by John Hancock. It has amassed assets over $402.28 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Mid Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.  Why Mid Cap Blend  With market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion, mid cap companies usually contain higher growth prospects than large cap companies, and are considered less risky than their small cap counterparts. Thus they have a nice balance of growth potential and stability. Blend ETFs are aptly named, since they tend to hold a mix of growth and value stocks, as well as show characteristics of both kinds of equities.  Costs  When considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal. Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.45%, making it one of the more expensive products in the space. It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.88%.  Sector Exposure and Top Holdings  While ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis. Looking at individual holdings, Jh Collateral accounts for about 5.07% of total assets, followed by Netapp Inc (NTAP) and Centene Corp (CNC). The top 10 holdings account for about 7.99% of total assets under management.  Performance and Risk  JHMM seeks to match the performance of the John Hancock Dimensional Mid Cap Index before fees and expenses. The John Hancock Dimensional Mid Cap Index comprises of a subset of securities in the U.S. Universe issued by companies whose market capitalizations are between the 200th and 951st largest U.S. company. The ETF has gained about 5.24% so far this year and was up about 14.02% in the last one year (as of 07/18/2018). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $30.70 and $36.29. The ETF has a beta of 1.02 and standard deviation of 12.73% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 688 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.  Alternatives  John Hancock Multifactor Mid Cap ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, JHMM is an excellent option for investors seeking exposure to the Mid Cap ETFs segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well. The Vanguard Mid-Cap ETF (VO) and the iShares Core S&P Mid-Cap ETF (IJH) track a similar index. While Vanguard Mid-Cap ETF has $23.82 B in assets, iShares Core S&P Mid-Cap ETF has $48.34 B. VO has an expense ratio of 0.05% and IJH charges 0.07%.  Bottom-Line  Passively managed ETFs are becoming increasingly popular with institutional as well as retail investors due to their low cost, transparency, flexibility and tax efficiency. They are excellent vehicles for long term investors.

"     PTC Inc. PTC  is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jul 18.  makeArticleAd();  In the last reported quarter, the company's adjusted earnings of 34 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by three cents. Notably, PTC has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with a positive average earnings surprise of 1.23%.    Notably, PTC's top line also outpaced the consensus mark in three of the trailing four quarters. In the last quarter, non-GAAP revenues came in at $308.2 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $303 million and increased 9.8% from the year-ago quarter.    Management anticipates third-quarter fiscal 2018 revenues between $310 million and $315 million, while adjusted earnings between 30 cents and 34 cents per share.    The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings and revenues are currently pegged at 32 cents and $313 million, respectively.    Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.    PTC Inc. Price and EPS Surprise        PTC Inc. Price and EPS Surprise    |      PTC Inc. Quote     Solid Bookings & Recurring Revenues Key Catalysts      PTC has been placed at the ""Visionaries"" quadrant by market research firm, Gartner, in its latest Magic Quadrant for Industrial IoT Platforms. The recognition reflects the company's portfolio strength, expanding partner base and solid clientele.    PTC's top line is expected to benefit from strong CAD and IoT bookings. Further, improving macro-economic conditions, particularly in the industrial sector, is expected to drive demand for the company's products in mature markets like CAD and PLM. Geographically, PTC expects bookings to increase in Europe, driven by strong large-deal pipeline.    Moreover, increasing recurring software revenue base (90% in the last reported quarter) is positive. The transition to subscription business model from a perpetual license model is further expected to drive recurring revenue growth.    Notably, PTC's ThingWorx continues to gain rapid adoption with the customers like Exxon Mobile and Airbus. The company's strengthening footprint in IoT driven ""Industrie 4.0"" factory automation is a major growth driver.    Additionally, strategic partnership with Microsoft MSFT  that combines ThingWorx and Azure IoT is helping PTC win new contracts.    However, a higher mix of subscription bookings is likely to hurt revenues in the going-to-be reported quarter. Further, increasing operating expenses due to LiveWorx and commissions are expected to hurt operating margin expansion.   What Our Model Says    According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP  has a good chance of beating estimates. The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided.    PTC has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -2.58%, which indicates an unlikely positive surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell, before they're reported, with our Earnings ESP Filter  .   Stocks to Consider    Here are few stocks you may consider as our proven model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.

"   InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBy now, the year 2018 can easily be credited to trade tensions. In the first half, the two countries targeted $50 billion of each other's goods for tit-for tat tariffs. But now, the situation has deteriorated with President Trump's latest threat of 10% tariffs on further $200 billion in products imported from China.makeArticleAd(); Source: istockphoto     Trump has even gone on to say that if Beijing continues to retaliate, the United States will impose a total tariff on  $550 billion  in Chinese goods - an amount that was not even the total U.S. import from China last year.Now, if any broader investing spectrum falls prey to such political tensions, then that will be the large caps. Though the large-cap index S&P 500 started 2018 on a better footing than the Russell 2000, the game started changing from mid-March. President Trump's protectionist agenda and the resultant trade war fears started weighing on large-cap stocks.Trade War Fear Seems Oversold, Time to Look at Better Data Points?Investors should note that after a nagging four-month trade war talks, investors seem to be ignoring the reality in July. U.S. stock futures are trading at a five-month high currently. This is especially true given that Chinese and U.S. officials have lately hinted at the prospect of recommencing talks over trade between the two countries.3 Buys to Catapult Your Dividends to 8.6%Three big ETFs including  SPDR S&P 500 ETF  (NYSEARCA: SPY ),  SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF  (NYSEARCA: DIA ) and  Invesco QQQ ETF  (NASDAQ: QQQ ) have added about 0.9%, 1.2% and 1.5%, respectively, in the past five days (as of Jul 12, 2018).Investors also shifted focus to upbeat U.S. economic data points from the trade war. U.S. employers added 213,000 new jobs in June, after an upwardly revised 244,000 in May. The number breezed past market expectations of 195,000. The momentum in the manufacturing sector is equally upbeat with the sector logging the strongest expansion in four months in June.If this was not enough, U.S. retail sales rose the maximum in six months in May. Sales increased 0.8% sequentially in the month, after an upwardly revised 0.4% growth in April, handily beating market expectations of a 0.4% rise.Earnings Growth Momentum SolidEarnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up 19.1% in Q2 on 8.2% higher revenues, per the  Earnings Trends  issued on Jul 11.  Investors should note that the present earnings cycle for the S&P 500 started from 2009, when the U.S. economy came out of its last recession.By now, the growth momentum should have slowed and reached the historical normalized pace of the mid-single-digits' level. But an expected double-digit growth rate for Q2 earnings is the result of the tax reform, per the Earnings Trends.The Atlanta Fed estimates real GDP growth in the second quarter of 2018 to be 3.8%, much higher than the 2.0% rate recorded in Q1. The combination of these factors should continue to boost growth stocks.Why Large Caps?Having said this, while all sorts of growth ETFs may scale higher, large-caps are likely to enjoy some special benefits. This is because, large-caps have been subdued this year on trade concerns, resulting in cheaper valuation.Secondly, large-cap stocks perform better in a falling dollar environment as these have wide foreign exposure. Along with many analysts, we too believe that "" tariffs, rising debt and deficits "" may put a downward pressure on the greenback. This could bode well for large-cap stocks.Given this, we have highlighted a few top-ranked, large-cap growth stocks for investors.

"Reuters  @media screen and (max-device-width: 480px){body{ font-size:30pt !important;}}    By Anna Irrera and Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi NEW YORK/ZURICH, July 19 (Reuters) - Swiss regulators are stepping up efforts to halt an exodus of cryptocurrency projects from the country, after two of only a handful of banks active in the nascent sector shut their doors on it in the last year. The departures, which industry sources fear will continue, mean Switzerland is losing business to offshore rivals including Liechtenstein, Gibraltar and the Cayman Islands, where banks are more welcoming.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','',''); The wealthy Swiss canton of Zug, for example, has been dubbed ""Crypto Valley"", with 200-300 virtual currency entities opening there in recent years. Zug's finance director, Heinz Taennler, says they may leave if the government does not take steps to give them access to the banking system, without which they struggle to function. ""All their banking relationships are going to Liechtenstein,"" he told Reuters. ""These are hundreds of jobs that have been created, and every job is important."" Thomas Moser, an alternate member of the governing board at the Swiss National Bank (SNB), said some cryptocurrency companies had asked the central to intervene. ""They raised concerns about problems with opening bank accounts, which was a worry for them, and asked for help,"" Moser told Reuters. ""I said this was not something the SNB dealt with, but they should speak with FINMA. FINMA, Switzerland's financial market supervisor, has held discussions with the SNB and bankers' association on how to make banks more accessible to cryptocurrency ventures. ""We would not want to close the door on the opportunities that such innovation (cryptocurrencies) might bring,"" Moser added. Providing the legal framework to launch ICOs and for banks to do business with cryptocurrency companies is not easy. The risk of fraud and lack of transparency about who owns cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether have made regulators around the world wary. The United States is among countries that are increasing scrutiny of the sector.   BANKS WARY Swiss banks are urging the authorities to give them more clarity on the rules that apply to cryptocurrency projects before providing services to the market, and at least two important players have withdrawn for now. Zuercher Kantonalbank (ZKB), the fourth largest Swiss bank and one of the few big banks in the world to welcome issuers of cryptocurrencies, has closed the accounts of more than 20 companies in the last year, industry sources told Reuters. A spokesman for ZKB declined to comment on any former or existing clients relationships, but said the bank does not do business with any cryptocurrency groups. Another large Swiss bank kicked out crypto project Smart Valor at around the same time, said a person familiar with the project. The source declined to name the bank. Only a handful of Switzerland's 250 banks ever allowed companies to deposit the cash equivalent of cryptocurrencies raised in ICOs. At least two still do, Reuters has established. But the involvement of a large bank like ZKB helped to establish Switzerland as an early cryptocurrency hub. ZKB and the bank that turned its back on Smart Valor began shutting their doors in October after a management feud severely damaged cryptocurrency project Tezos, which had conducted Zug's largest ICO, entrepreneurs and advisers said.  Swiss banks are worried because some companies that carried out ICOs did not do anti-money laundering (AML) checks on their contributors, industry sources said. This means the banks themselves could fall foul of AML rules.   LIECHTENSTEIN A WINNER ""A cautionary response from Swiss banks resulted in a pause or closure for most projects in the cryptocurrency space,""  said David Henderson, founder of the Swiss Sweetbridge Foundation, set up to conduct blockchain startup Sweetbridge's ICO. Sweetbridge was in the late stages of securing an account with ZKB, but the application was put on hold a few days after the Tezos scandal erupted, Henderson said. The project ultimately decided not to carry out its planned ICO through the Swiss foundation, setting up entities and bank accounts in Gibraltar and Liechtenstein instead. It is difficult for crypto-projects to use the funds they raise through ICOs if they are locked out of the banking system. Funds from ICOs are often originally raised in cryptocurrencies bitcoin and ether, which have limited use as a means of payment in the broader economy. ""I cannot pay salaries because our money is caught up there. We cannot move it,"" said the founder of a Swiss crypto-firm which has had accounts closed at three different banks. The banks have asked the firm to take out its money, but it is unable to do so without first finding another banking relationship, the founder added. At least two Swiss banks are still accepting ICO funds, according to checks by Reuters. These are Banca Zarattini, a small bank in the Italian-language canton Ticino, and Hypothekarbank Lenzburg, a regional lender located between Zurich and Basel, which recently began accepting crypto customers. Banca Zarattini only banks ICO companies with KYC (know-your-customer) and AML procedures that are in compliance with Swiss law, it said. Hypothekarbank Lenzburg said it had started to accept crytocurrency companies and could charge an initial assessment fee of up to 2,500 Swiss francs($2,500). Bank Frick in Liechtenstein has become a popular alternative for Swiss entities struggling to secure accounts. It banks around 160 crypto-enterprises or projects, of which 60 are in the process of setting up an ICO, the bank told Reuters. The bank, however, declined 90 percent of account requests from cryptocurrency companies and only accepts ICOs based onshore in Switzerland or Liechtenstein, it said.   RULES AND REASSURANCES Despite the challenges, Switzerland is working on new rules to reassure banks and encourage them to accept the accounts of cryptocurrency companies. The country has dropped from second place in 2017 to sixth this year in a country ranking of the sum of ICO funds raised,  according to a study published by PwC and the Crypto Valley Association in June. The Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands topped the list. In May, Swiss Finance Minister Ueli Maurer invited FINMA, the central bank and the Swiss Bankers Association (SBA) to a roundtable discussion on bank accounts for cryptocurrencies. After the meeting, the SBA set up a working group to compile a set of checks and conditions that all banks could follow when opening an account for cryptocurrency firms. ""Banks are currently hesitant to open business accounts for companies with particular touchpoints to ICOs and cryptocurrencies - due to risks such as fraud or money laundering,"" SBA said in a statement. Zug finance director Taennler said the aim set out during the meeting, which he attended, was to have a set of FINMA-approved guidelines for assessing prospective cryptocurrency clients by the year-end. FINMA has already issued separate guidelines to spell out how Swiss AML rules and securities regulations apply to various ICOs. But securities rules are less stringent in Switzerland than in the United States, where the Securities and Exchange Commission has toughened its stance on ICOs.  This makes it more risky for banks in Switzerland to be involved with ICO projects which may have raised money from U.S. contributors and could fall under the purview of the SEC. Switzerland's authorities have said they want to create conditions for the country to remain competitive but with no room for scams or financial crime. The finance ministry is also looking at the broader legal framework for blockchain technology and ICOs. Its findings will be presented to the federal government by the end of the year and will determine how the technology fits into existing Swiss laws and regulations.

"    When you were a young'un, your parents may have sat you down   to talk about the ""birds and the bees."" Now it's time to turn the   tables and address another uncomfortable topic: their   finances. Such conversations mark a reversal in the traditional   parent-child dynamic, and also can be fraught with concerns over   independence, trust and mortality. As a result, these talks often   don't happen at all, and a perceived lack of urgency is to blame,   according to a 2018 survey conducted by Wells Fargo. Roughly one-third of parents over the age of 60 say they've   never discussed later-life needs with family, including   inheritance plans, beneficiaries, important documents or   designated representatives, according to the survey. Meanwhile,   adult children worry such conversations will cause conflict or   make it seem as though they're after their parents' money.makeArticleAd(); As daunting as it may seem, it's important to have ""the talk""   about finances with your parents to help protect them from scams   and elder abuse, which cost Americans more than $36 billion each   year, according to financial services firm True Link Financial.   These conversations also ensure that a rapid-response plan is in   place in the event of disability and that there are no surprises   after your parents die, says Ron Long, head of regulatory affairs   and elder client initiatives at Wells Fargo Advisors. These four tips can open lines of communication. 1. Start with one conversation When's a good time to sit your parents down for a hard   conversation about their financial well-being, plans for the   future and important legal and financial documents like a will,   power of attorney or health care directives?

"    When you were a young'un, your parents may have sat you down   to talk about the ""birds and the bees."" Now it's time to turn the   tables and address another uncomfortable topic: their   finances. Such conversations mark a reversal in the traditional   parent-child dynamic, and also can be fraught with concerns over   independence, trust and mortality. As a result, these talks often   don't happen at all, and a perceived lack of urgency is to blame,   according to a 2018 survey conducted by Wells Fargo. Roughly one-third of parents over the age of 60 say they've   never discussed later-life needs with family, including   inheritance plans, beneficiaries, important documents or   designated representatives, according to the survey. Meanwhile,   adult children worry such conversations will cause conflict or   make it seem as though they're after their parents' money.makeArticleAd(); As daunting as it may seem, it's important to have ""the talk""   about finances with your parents to help protect them from scams   and elder abuse, which cost Americans more than $36 billion each   year, according to financial services firm True Link Financial.   These conversations also ensure that a rapid-response plan is in   place in the event of disability and that there are no surprises   after your parents die, says Ron Long, head of regulatory affairs   and elder client initiatives at Wells Fargo Advisors. These four tips can open lines of communication. 1.

"    The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a shock weekly build as domestic output hit 11 million barrels a day for the very first time. Despite the record production, U.S. benchmark crude futures gained 1% (or 68 cents) to $68.76 per barrel Wednesday. The positive price movement was supported by strong demand for refined product inventories.  Soaring U.S. Output  The talking point from the data sets was the steady trend of rising domestic oil production. Pumping at the rate of 11 million barrels per day, output in the United States is now ahead of Saudi Arabia and second only to Russia. Not surprisingly, a number of companies involved in oil production have generated handsome returns year to date. Stocks like Marathon Oil Corporation MRO  , Hess Corporation HES  , Anadarko Petroleum Corporation APC  and ConocoPhillips COP  have each gained in excess of 20% in 2018.  Analysis of the EIA Data    Crude Oil:   The federal government's EIA report revealed that crude inventories jumped by 5.8 million barrels for the week ending Jul 13, following a steep decrease of 12.6 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts - the leading independent commodities and energy data provider - had expected crude stocks to go down some 3 million barrels. Record high domestic production and sharp rise in imports led to the surprise stockpile build with the world's biggest oil consumer. In particular, output in the United States rose by 100,000 barrels per day last week to 11 million barrels per day - the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. In early February, oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold for the first time in nearly 50 years and has maintained the record levels thereafter. Despite last week's increase, oil inventories have generally trended lower in a year and a half. In fact, stockpiles have shrunk in 45 of the last 67 weeks and are down nearly 80 million barrels in the past year. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 411.1 million barrels, current crude supplies are 16% below the year-ago figure and 2% under the five-year average. Importantly, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma - the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange - fell 860,000 barrels to 24.9 million barrels. The crude supply cover was up from 22.9 days in the previous week to 23.4 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 28.7 days.   Gasoline:   Gasoline supplies were down for the third week on stronger demand. The 3.2 million barrels draw - above the polled number of one million barrels fall in supply level - took gasoline stockpiles down to 235.8 million barrels. Following last week's decline, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product is now 2% above the year-earlier level and is 5% over the five-year range.   Distillate:   Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) edged down 371,000 barrels last week. Meanwhile, analysts expected the supply level to decrease by 45,000 barrels. The first fall in five weeks could be attributed to higher demand. At 121.3 million barrels, current supplies are 20% below the year-ago level and 13% lower than the five-year average.   Refinery Rates:   Refinery utilization was down by 2.4% from the prior week to 94.3%.  About the Weekly Petroleum Status Report  The Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad. The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current  oil prices  and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.  Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?

"  @media screen and (max-device-width: 480px){body{ font-size:30pt !important;}}    By Ole Petter Skonnord OSLO, July 18 (Reuters) - Investment firm Aker, controlled by billionaire Kjell Inge Roekke, expects to pay higher dividends as the value of its energy-heavy portfolio rise, CEO Oevind Eriksen told Reuters on Wednesday. Aker's net asset value surged by over a third to 57.1 billion crowns ($7.00 billion) during the second quarter, equal to 769 crowns per share.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','',''); ""We have no plan to change our dividend policy, so that (a rise in dividend) is a mathematical consequence of our success,"" Eriksen said, referring to its policy of paying out 2-4 percent of its net asset value in annual dividends. Nor does the firm have any plan to reduce its exposure to Aker BP, which at the end of the second quarter accounted for 65 percent of Aker's net asset value. ""We have no plans to reduce our stake in Aker BP,"" Eriksen said. He instead saw opportunities for more growth in Aker BP. ""Aker BP has a portfolio that produces approximately 160,000 barrels per day and has the potential to double in a few years. ""Aker BP doesn't need to make more transactions, although we  want to grow through further transactions. But we will show discipline and the most important thing for our shareholders is that we have a high quality portfolio,"" Eriksen said. While Aker BP only has assets on the Norwegian continental shelf, start-up Aker Energy earlier this year bought a 50-percent stake in Ghana's ultra deepwater Tano Cape Three Points block from Hess. ""We have agreed with the authorities in Ghana to postpone the deadline for submitting a plan for development from July to the end of the year. It was a simple decision, because a postponement allows for an even more elaborate plan. ""But from our side, postponement of the deadline does not imply any delay to the expected production start. It's still in 2021, but more realistic towards the end of the year than the start,"" Eriksen said. Ghana is Aker Energy's main priority in Africa, but Eriksen said he would not rule out investments in other African countries. Other companies in Aker's portfolio include stakes in oil services firms Aker Solutions, Akastor, Kværner, Solstad Farstad  and Ocean Yield. Apart from Ocean Yield, which is also involved in shipping, Eriksen did not expect dividends from any of them in the short term.

"Reuters  @media screen and (max-device-width: 480px){body{ font-size:30pt !important;}}    By Anna Irrera and Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi NEW YORK/ZURICH, July 19 (Reuters) - Swiss regulators are stepping up efforts to halt an exodus of cryptocurrency projects from the country, after two of only a handful of banks active in the nascent sector shut their doors on it in the last year. The departures, which industry sources fear will continue, mean Switzerland is losing business to offshore rivals including Liechtenstein, Gibraltar and the Cayman Islands, where banks are more welcoming.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','',''); The wealthy Swiss canton of Zug, for example, has been dubbed ""Crypto Valley"", with 200-300 virtual currency entities opening there in recent years. Zug's finance director, Heinz Taennler, says they may leave if the government does not take steps to give them access to the banking system, without which they struggle to function. ""All their banking relationships are going to Liechtenstein,"" he told Reuters. ""These are hundreds of jobs that have been created, and every job is important."" Thomas Moser, an alternate member of the governing board at the Swiss National Bank (SNB), said some cryptocurrency companies had asked the central to intervene. ""They raised concerns about problems with opening bank accounts, which was a worry for them, and asked for help,"" Moser told Reuters. ""I said this was not something the SNB dealt with, but they should speak with FINMA. FINMA, Switzerland's financial market supervisor, has held discussions with the SNB and bankers' association on how to make banks more accessible to cryptocurrency ventures. ""We would not want to close the door on the opportunities that such innovation (cryptocurrencies) might bring,"" Moser added. Providing the legal framework to launch ICOs and for banks to do business with cryptocurrency companies is not easy. The risk of fraud and lack of transparency about who owns cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether have made regulators around the world wary. The United States is among countries that are increasing scrutiny of the sector.   BANKS WARY Swiss banks are urging the authorities to give them more clarity on the rules that apply to cryptocurrency projects before providing services to the market, and at least two important players have withdrawn for now. Zuercher Kantonalbank (ZKB), the fourth largest Swiss bank and one of the few big banks in the world to welcome issuers of cryptocurrencies, has closed the accounts of more than 20 companies in the last year, industry sources told Reuters. A spokesman for ZKB declined to comment on any former or existing clients relationships, but said the bank does not do business with any cryptocurrency groups. Another large Swiss bank kicked out crypto project Smart Valor at around the same time, said a person familiar with the project. The source declined to name the bank. Only a handful of Switzerland's 250 banks ever allowed companies to deposit the cash equivalent of cryptocurrencies raised in ICOs. At least two still do, Reuters has established. But the involvement of a large bank like ZKB helped to establish Switzerland as an early cryptocurrency hub. ZKB and the bank that turned its back on Smart Valor began shutting their doors in October after a management feud severely damaged cryptocurrency project Tezos, which had conducted Zug's largest ICO, entrepreneurs and advisers said.  Swiss banks are worried because some companies that carried out ICOs did not do anti-money laundering (AML) checks on their contributors, industry sources said. This means the banks themselves could fall foul of AML rules.   LIECHTENSTEIN A WINNER ""A cautionary response from Swiss banks resulted in a pause or closure for most projects in the cryptocurrency space,""  said David Henderson, founder of the Swiss Sweetbridge Foundation, set up to conduct blockchain startup Sweetbridge's ICO. Sweetbridge was in the late stages of securing an account with ZKB, but the application was put on hold a few days after the Tezos scandal erupted, Henderson said. The project ultimately decided not to carry out its planned ICO through the Swiss foundation, setting up entities and bank accounts in Gibraltar and Liechtenstein instead. It is difficult for crypto-projects to use the funds they raise through ICOs if they are locked out of the banking system. Funds from ICOs are often originally raised in cryptocurrencies bitcoin and ether, which have limited use as a means of payment in the broader economy. ""I cannot pay salaries because our money is caught up there. We cannot move it,"" said the founder of a Swiss crypto-firm which has had accounts closed at three different banks. The banks have asked the firm to take out its money, but it is unable to do so without first finding another banking relationship, the founder added. At least two Swiss banks are still accepting ICO funds, according to checks by Reuters. These are Banca Zarattini, a small bank in the Italian-language canton Ticino, and Hypothekarbank Lenzburg, a regional lender located between Zurich and Basel, which recently began accepting crypto customers. Banca Zarattini only banks ICO companies with KYC (know-your-customer) and AML procedures that are in compliance with Swiss law, it said. Hypothekarbank Lenzburg said it had started to accept crytocurrency companies and could charge an initial assessment fee of up to 2,500 Swiss francs($2,500). Bank Frick in Liechtenstein has become a popular alternative for Swiss entities struggling to secure accounts. It banks around 160 crypto-enterprises or projects, of which 60 are in the process of setting up an ICO, the bank told Reuters. The bank, however, declined 90 percent of account requests from cryptocurrency companies and only accepts ICOs based onshore in Switzerland or Liechtenstein, it said.   RULES AND REASSURANCES Despite the challenges, Switzerland is working on new rules to reassure banks and encourage them to accept the accounts of cryptocurrency companies. The country has dropped from second place in 2017 to sixth this year in a country ranking of the sum of ICO funds raised,  according to a study published by PwC and the Crypto Valley Association in June. The Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands topped the list. In May, Swiss Finance Minister Ueli Maurer invited FINMA, the central bank and the Swiss Bankers Association (SBA) to a roundtable discussion on bank accounts for cryptocurrencies. After the meeting, the SBA set up a working group to compile a set of checks and conditions that all banks could follow when opening an account for cryptocurrency firms. ""Banks are currently hesitant to open business accounts for companies with particular touchpoints to ICOs and cryptocurrencies - due to risks such as fraud or money laundering,"" SBA said in a statement. Zug finance director Taennler said the aim set out during the meeting, which he attended, was to have a set of FINMA-approved guidelines for assessing prospective cryptocurrency clients by the year-end. FINMA has already issued separate guidelines to spell out how Swiss AML rules and securities regulations apply to various ICOs. But securities rules are less stringent in Switzerland than in the United States, where the Securities and Exchange Commission has toughened its stance on ICOs.  This makes it more risky for banks in Switzerland to be involved with ICO projects which may have raised money from U.S. contributors and could fall under the purview of the SEC. Switzerland's authorities have said they want to create conditions for the country to remain competitive but with no room for scams or financial crime. The finance ministry is also looking at the broader legal framework for blockchain technology and ICOs. Its findings will be presented to the federal government by the end of the year and will determine how the technology fits into existing Swiss laws and regulations.

"    When you were a young'un, your parents may have sat you down   to talk about the ""birds and the bees."" Now it's time to turn the   tables and address another uncomfortable topic: their   finances. Such conversations mark a reversal in the traditional   parent-child dynamic, and also can be fraught with concerns over   independence, trust and mortality. As a result, these talks often   don't happen at all, and a perceived lack of urgency is to blame,   according to a 2018 survey conducted by Wells Fargo. Roughly one-third of parents over the age of 60 say they've   never discussed later-life needs with family, including   inheritance plans, beneficiaries, important documents or   designated representatives, according to the survey. Meanwhile,   adult children worry such conversations will cause conflict or   make it seem as though they're after their parents' money.makeArticleAd(); As daunting as it may seem, it's important to have ""the talk""   about finances with your parents to help protect them from scams   and elder abuse, which cost Americans more than $36 billion each   year, according to financial services firm True Link Financial.   These conversations also ensure that a rapid-response plan is in   place in the event of disability and that there are no surprises   after your parents die, says Ron Long, head of regulatory affairs   and elder client initiatives at Wells Fargo Advisors. These four tips can open lines of communication. 1. Start with one conversation When's a good time to sit your parents down for a hard   conversation about their financial well-being, plans for the   future and important legal and financial documents like a will,   power of attorney or health care directives? The twelfth of   never, for most children. Don't wait for tragedy to strike. A study by Ameriprise   Financial found that a life-altering incident was the trigger for   90% of children who'd actually discussed estate planning with   their parents.  » Unfamiliar with estate planning?     See our   7-step checklist  Instead, carve out time for a family meeting - perhaps on   Mother's Day, Father's Day or the Friday after Thanksgiving -   when all the children are present, Long recommends. ""It's a good   way to get the conversation started and then you can do a   refresher or update down the road."" The first conversation should serve as a door-opener. There   are weighty decisions at play - which may change over time with   your parents' mental or physical health - so don't expect a   one-and-done conversation. 2. Begin with the basics Talking about money inspires reactions ranging from secretive   to forthright. Even if your parents aren't particularly prickly   about discussing their finances, it's prudent to ease into such   conversations. Long says a strategy that's ""very helpful"" is approaching   discussions from a group-planning perspective - sharing what   end-of-life goals you're considering and asking your parents   about theirs. ""Remember, these are subjects that a lot of older   folks hold close to their hearts,"" he says. Be sensitive when starting that initial conversation. Think   less interrogative (how much money's at stake and who gets what?)   and more collaborative (exchanging information about where   accounts are held or who has power of attorney). 3. Broach serious topics Once you've established a rapport, tackle topics that make   either you or your parents uncomfortable, including the morose   (funeral arrangements or declining health) and the dangerous   (financial scams targeting seniors that could wipe out their   savings). Don't let the prospect of an awkward conversation now create a   bigger headache in the future. Strive for this balance:   confronting reality head-on without infantilizing or offending   your parents. A bad way to deal? Shutting down future   conversations when talks are strained. A better way to deal?   Involving other family members to facilitate discussion or   working with a financial advisor to handle trickier topics. (Here   are some tips on   choosing a financial advisor    .) 4. Leave judgment at the door Conversations with your parents may reveal wildly different   opinions about how to handle finances. You're asking them to part   with sensitive information; promise a judgment-free zone in   return. Because of the prevalence of financial abuse - it's estimated   one in five elders have been impacted - urge your parents to flag   potential scams. Avoid shaming them for ill-advised financial   decisions or falling victim to fraud. Instead, focus on   prevention, via routine communication about finances and keeping   documents accurate and up-to-date.

Don't let the prospect of an awkward conversation now create a   bigger headache in the future. Strive for this balance:   confronting reality head-on without infantilizing or offending   your parents. A bad way to deal? Shutting down future   conversations when talks are strained. A better way to deal?   Involving other family members to facilitate discussion or   working with a financial advisor to handle trickier topics. (Here   are some tips on   choosing a financial advisor    .) 4. Leave judgment at the door Conversations with your parents may reveal wildly different   opinions about how to handle finances. You're asking them to part   with sensitive information; promise a judgment-free zone in   return. Because of the prevalence of financial abuse - it's estimated   one in five elders have been impacted - urge your parents to flag   potential scams. Avoid shaming them for ill-advised financial   decisions or falling victim to fraud. Instead, focus on   prevention, via routine communication about finances and keeping   documents accurate and up-to-date. Here are some additional   steps for helping your parents protect their   money    .

"   Investors in Idexx Laboratories, Inc. (Symbol: IDXX) saw new options begin trading this week, for the August 17th expiration. At Stock Options Channel  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the IDXX options chain for the new August 17th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.    The put contract at the $190.00 strike price has a current bid of 80 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $190.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $189.20 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of IDXX, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $235.53/share today. Because the $190.00 strike represents an approximate 19% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 100%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.42% return on the cash commitment, or 4.04% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost  .  makeArticleAd();  Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Idexx Laboratories, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $190.00 strike is located relative to that history:       Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $240.00 strike price has a current bid of $7.20. If an investor was to purchase shares of IDXX stock at the current price level of $235.53/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $240.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.95% if the stock gets called away at the August 17th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if IDXX shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Idexx Laboratories, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing IDXX's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $240.00 strike highlighted in red:    Considering the fact that the $240.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.06% boost of extra return to the investor, or 29.36% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost  .    The implied volatility in the put contract example is 47%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 35%.    Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $235.53) to be 26%.

The departures, which industry sources fear will continue, mean Switzerland is losing business to offshore rivals including Liechtenstein, Gibraltar and the Cayman Islands, where banks are more welcoming.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','',''); The wealthy Swiss canton of Zug, for example, has been dubbed ""Crypto Valley"", with 200-300 virtual currency entities opening there in recent years. Zug's finance director, Heinz Taennler, says they may leave if the government does not take steps to give them access to the banking system, without which they struggle to function. ""All their banking relationships are going to Liechtenstein,"" he told Reuters. ""These are hundreds of jobs that have been created, and every job is important."" Thomas Moser, an alternate member of the governing board at the Swiss National Bank (SNB), said some cryptocurrency companies had asked the central to intervene. ""They raised concerns about problems with opening bank accounts, which was a worry for them, and asked for help,"" Moser told Reuters. ""I said this was not something the SNB dealt with, but they should speak with FINMA. FINMA, Switzerland's financial market supervisor, has held discussions with the SNB and bankers' association on how to make banks more accessible to cryptocurrency ventures. ""We would not want to close the door on the opportunities that such innovation (cryptocurrencies) might bring,"" Moser added. Providing the legal framework to launch ICOs and for banks to do business with cryptocurrency companies is not easy. The risk of fraud and lack of transparency about who owns cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether have made regulators around the world wary. The United States is among countries that are increasing scrutiny of the sector.   BANKS WARY Swiss banks are urging the authorities to give them more clarity on the rules that apply to cryptocurrency projects before providing services to the market, and at least two important players have withdrawn for now. Zuercher Kantonalbank (ZKB), the fourth largest Swiss bank and one of the few big banks in the world to welcome issuers of cryptocurrencies, has closed the accounts of more than 20 companies in the last year, industry sources told Reuters. A spokesman for ZKB declined to comment on any former or existing clients relationships, but said the bank does not do business with any cryptocurrency groups. Another large Swiss bank kicked out crypto project Smart Valor at around the same time, said a person familiar with the project. The source declined to name the bank. Only a handful of Switzerland's 250 banks ever allowed companies to deposit the cash equivalent of cryptocurrencies raised in ICOs. At least two still do, Reuters has established. But the involvement of a large bank like ZKB helped to establish Switzerland as an early cryptocurrency hub. ZKB and the bank that turned its back on Smart Valor began shutting their doors in October after a management feud severely damaged cryptocurrency project Tezos, which had conducted Zug's largest ICO, entrepreneurs and advisers said.  Swiss banks are worried because some companies that carried out ICOs did not do anti-money laundering (AML) checks on their contributors, industry sources said. This means the banks themselves could fall foul of AML rules.   LIECHTENSTEIN A WINNER ""A cautionary response from Swiss banks resulted in a pause or closure for most projects in the cryptocurrency space,""  said David Henderson, founder of the Swiss Sweetbridge Foundation, set up to conduct blockchain startup Sweetbridge's ICO. Sweetbridge was in the late stages of securing an account with ZKB, but the application was put on hold a few days after the Tezos scandal erupted, Henderson said. The project ultimately decided not to carry out its planned ICO through the Swiss foundation, setting up entities and bank accounts in Gibraltar and Liechtenstein instead. It is difficult for crypto-projects to use the funds they raise through ICOs if they are locked out of the banking system. Funds from ICOs are often originally raised in cryptocurrencies bitcoin and ether, which have limited use as a means of payment in the broader economy. ""I cannot pay salaries because our money is caught up there. We cannot move it,"" said the founder of a Swiss crypto-firm which has had accounts closed at three different banks. The banks have asked the firm to take out its money, but it is unable to do so without first finding another banking relationship, the founder added. At least two Swiss banks are still accepting ICO funds, according to checks by Reuters. These are Banca Zarattini, a small bank in the Italian-language canton Ticino, and Hypothekarbank Lenzburg, a regional lender located between Zurich and Basel, which recently began accepting crypto customers. Banca Zarattini only banks ICO companies with KYC (know-your-customer) and AML procedures that are in compliance with Swiss law, it said. Hypothekarbank Lenzburg said it had started to accept crytocurrency companies and could charge an initial assessment fee of up to 2,500 Swiss francs($2,500). Bank Frick in Liechtenstein has become a popular alternative for Swiss entities struggling to secure accounts. It banks around 160 crypto-enterprises or projects, of which 60 are in the process of setting up an ICO, the bank told Reuters. The bank, however, declined 90 percent of account requests from cryptocurrency companies and only accepts ICOs based onshore in Switzerland or Liechtenstein, it said.   RULES AND REASSURANCES Despite the challenges, Switzerland is working on new rules to reassure banks and encourage them to accept the accounts of cryptocurrency companies. The country has dropped from second place in 2017 to sixth this year in a country ranking of the sum of ICO funds raised,  according to a study published by PwC and the Crypto Valley Association in June. The Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands topped the list. In May, Swiss Finance Minister Ueli Maurer invited FINMA, the central bank and the Swiss Bankers Association (SBA) to a roundtable discussion on bank accounts for cryptocurrencies. After the meeting, the SBA set up a working group to compile a set of checks and conditions that all banks could follow when opening an account for cryptocurrency firms. ""Banks are currently hesitant to open business accounts for companies with particular touchpoints to ICOs and cryptocurrencies - due to risks such as fraud or money laundering,"" SBA said in a statement. Zug finance director Taennler said the aim set out during the meeting, which he attended, was to have a set of FINMA-approved guidelines for assessing prospective cryptocurrency clients by the year-end. FINMA has already issued separate guidelines to spell out how Swiss AML rules and securities regulations apply to various ICOs. But securities rules are less stringent in Switzerland than in the United States, where the Securities and Exchange Commission has toughened its stance on ICOs.  This makes it more risky for banks in Switzerland to be involved with ICO projects which may have raised money from U.S. contributors and could fall under the purview of the SEC. Switzerland's authorities have said they want to create conditions for the country to remain competitive but with no room for scams or financial crime. The finance ministry is also looking at the broader legal framework for blockchain technology and ICOs. Its findings will be presented to the federal government by the end of the year and will determine how the technology fits into existing Swiss laws and regulations.

"    When you were a young'un, your parents may have sat you down   to talk about the ""birds and the bees."" Now it's time to turn the   tables and address another uncomfortable topic: their   finances. Such conversations mark a reversal in the traditional   parent-child dynamic, and also can be fraught with concerns over   independence, trust and mortality. As a result, these talks often   don't happen at all, and a perceived lack of urgency is to blame,   according to a 2018 survey conducted by Wells Fargo. Roughly one-third of parents over the age of 60 say they've   never discussed later-life needs with family, including   inheritance plans, beneficiaries, important documents or   designated representatives, according to the survey. Meanwhile,   adult children worry such conversations will cause conflict or   make it seem as though they're after their parents' money.makeArticleAd(); As daunting as it may seem, it's important to have ""the talk""   about finances with your parents to help protect them from scams   and elder abuse, which cost Americans more than $36 billion each   year, according to financial services firm True Link Financial.   These conversations also ensure that a rapid-response plan is in   place in the event of disability and that there are no surprises   after your parents die, says Ron Long, head of regulatory affairs   and elder client initiatives at Wells Fargo Advisors. These four tips can open lines of communication. 1. Start with one conversation When's a good time to sit your parents down for a hard   conversation about their financial well-being, plans for the   future and important legal and financial documents like a will,   power of attorney or health care directives? The twelfth of   never, for most children. Don't wait for tragedy to strike. A study by Ameriprise   Financial found that a life-altering incident was the trigger for   90% of children who'd actually discussed estate planning with   their parents.  » Unfamiliar with estate planning?     See our   7-step checklist  Instead, carve out time for a family meeting - perhaps on   Mother's Day, Father's Day or the Friday after Thanksgiving -   when all the children are present, Long recommends. ""It's a good   way to get the conversation started and then you can do a   refresher or update down the road."" The first conversation should serve as a door-opener. There   are weighty decisions at play - which may change over time with   your parents' mental or physical health - so don't expect a   one-and-done conversation. 2. Begin with the basics Talking about money inspires reactions ranging from secretive   to forthright. Even if your parents aren't particularly prickly   about discussing their finances, it's prudent to ease into such   conversations. Long says a strategy that's ""very helpful"" is approaching   discussions from a group-planning perspective - sharing what   end-of-life goals you're considering and asking your parents   about theirs. ""Remember, these are subjects that a lot of older   folks hold close to their hearts,"" he says. Be sensitive when starting that initial conversation. Think   less interrogative (how much money's at stake and who gets what?)   and more collaborative (exchanging information about where   accounts are held or who has power of attorney). 3. Broach serious topics Once you've established a rapport, tackle topics that make   either you or your parents uncomfortable, including the morose   (funeral arrangements or declining health) and the dangerous   (financial scams targeting seniors that could wipe out their   savings). Don't let the prospect of an awkward conversation now create a   bigger headache in the future. Strive for this balance:   confronting reality head-on without infantilizing or offending   your parents. A bad way to deal? Shutting down future   conversations when talks are strained. A better way to deal?   Involving other family members to facilitate discussion or   working with a financial advisor to handle trickier topics. (Here   are some tips on   choosing a financial advisor    .) 4. Leave judgment at the door Conversations with your parents may reveal wildly different   opinions about how to handle finances. You're asking them to part   with sensitive information; promise a judgment-free zone in   return. Because of the prevalence of financial abuse - it's estimated   one in five elders have been impacted - urge your parents to flag   potential scams. Avoid shaming them for ill-advised financial   decisions or falling victim to fraud. Instead, focus on   prevention, via routine communication about finances and keeping   documents accurate and up-to-date.

You're asking them to part   with sensitive information; promise a judgment-free zone in   return. Because of the prevalence of financial abuse - it's estimated   one in five elders have been impacted - urge your parents to flag   potential scams. Avoid shaming them for ill-advised financial   decisions or falling victim to fraud. Instead, focus on   prevention, via routine communication about finances and keeping   documents accurate and up-to-date.

"What happened Shares of creative software applications provider   Adobe Systems Incorporated    (NASDAQ: ADBE)  rose 39.1% in the first six months of 2018,   according to data from      S&P Global Market Intelligence    . So what Adobe continued the impressive performance of recent quarters   in the first half of 2018. During the company's fiscal second   quarter (three months ended June 1, 2018), Adobe's revenue   achieved 24% year-over-year growth, setting a new quarterly   record of $2.2 billion. Top-line gains were spurred by the   organization's largest segment, digital media, which includes the   professional content software Adobe Creative Suite. Digital   media's revenue jumped 22% against the second quarter of 2017, to   $1.55 billion. Similarly, the digital experience segment, which   assists companies in multi-channel digital marketing campaigns,   booked revenue growth of 18%, to $586 million. Impressively, as Adobe grows larger, it keeps expanding its   profitability.   Operating margin    has increased steadily over the last four years, roughly tripling   to a current level of 32%. This ample margin is positively   impacting cash flow: Adobe boosted operating cash flow by more   than 50% in the second quarter of 2018 versus the prior-year   period, to $976.4 million. The company is using some of its   ongoing cash haul for shareholder-friendly actions: Last quarter,   Adobe repurchased $700 million of its shares on the open   market.makeArticleAd();   Image source: Getty Images. Now what Adobe is investing in extending its lead in content creation.   Last month, the company completed the $1.68 billion acquisition   of privately held Magento Commerce. Magento will enhance Adobe   Experience Cloud, the company's enterprise-targeted content   management system (CMS). Beginning in the third quarter, Adobe   will merge Magento's ""Commerce Cloud"" into Adobe Experience   Cloud, simplifying the creation of shopping sites for the   software's users, and providing them with advanced   commerce-related analytics. It's possible that shares may take a breather at some point in   the upcoming quarters given the tremendous run-up so far in 2018.   However, its recent appreciation hasn't thrown Adobe into   overvalued territory. Company stock trades at a forward   price-to-earnings ratio of 38; that's a rich premium to the   broader market, but in line with application software stocks in   the S&P 500 index, which currently trade at an aggregate   forward P/E ratio of 37. Given its sustained revenue and   earnings growth at double-digit rates, and ascending   profitability, Adobe arguably deserves a richer valuation.   10 stocks we like better than Adobe Systems       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

"     HP Inc. HPQ  recently introduced the HP Z Workstation series, reportedly the most powerful and secure entry workstations, characterized by cost-effective graphics performance and flexible configuration options.  makeArticleAd();  With this new product, the company expects to address the growing complexities of workflows and make these more productive without compromising on graphics power, expandability and most importantly, security.   What the Product is Offering    The new HP Z2 Mini, HP Z2 Small Form Factor and HP Z2 Tower, as well as the HP EliteDesk 800 Workstation Edition comprise built-in end-to-end HP security solutions including HP Sure Start Gen43 and HP Sure Run4, to protect devices from evolving malware threats.    Further, the company's Manageability Kit Gen 2 effectively manages multiple devices.    Notably, the HP Z2 Workstations can be connected with the interconnect technology Thunderbolt to ensure speedy device connections.   Growth Driving Efforts    Product innovation is one of the key drivers that have helped HP in maintaining its leading position. The company is also one of the largest sellers of printers.    For the last several quarters, HP is trying to accelerate sales of its PCs and printers through product innovation and differentiation.    In the past year, HP has launched several new innovative models in the PC segment, including ZBook x2 PC Workstation, HP Sure View, HP EliteBook 1040 and 840.    In the Printing segment, the company has unveiled products like PageWide XL and DeskJet GT and is planning to widen its 3D printing portfolio.    Per a latest report by IDC, HP led the PC market in the second-quarter of 2018 with a market share of 23.9%, driven by higher demand in business markets due to migration to Microsoft's MSFT  Windows 10.    However, with the passage of Window's 10 replacement cycle, the demand from the business circle is anticipated to weaken, which poses a concern for the companies.    We therefore believe that the continuous innovative product launches will help HP stay afloat in the current uncertain environment.    HP Inc. Revenue (TTM)        HP Inc.

"   makeZacksArticleAd();Investors seeking strong returns may allocate their assets in stocks with significant liquidity. Liquidity is an important yardstick that indicates a company's capability to meet debt obligations by converting assets into cash.   A company with a favorable liquidity position has the potential to generate higher returns as liquidity drives growth. However, one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate than its peers, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.   Hence, the efficiency level of a company should be considered in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners as this combination indicates underlying financial strength.Measures to Identify Liquid StocksCurrent Ratio: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company's potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio - also known as working capital ratio - below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal.Quick Ratio: Unlike current ratio, quick ratio - also called ""acid-test ratio"" or ""quick assets ratio"" - indicates a company's ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable.Cash Ratio : This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company's ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio of more than 1 may point to sound financials, a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.   So, a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company's financial condition.Screening Parameters   In order to pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization, which is a widely used measure of a company's efficiency, as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient.   In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential, we have added our proprietary Growth Style Score to the screen.Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3 (While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable, significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency.)Asset utilization greater than industry average (Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company's efficiency.)Zacks Rank equal to #1 (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here . Growth Score less than or equal to B (Back-tested results show that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 handily beat other stocks.)

"Reuters  @media screen and (max-device-width: 480px){body{ font-size:30pt !important;}}    By Salvador Rodriguez SAN FRANCISCO, July 18 (Reuters) - In the elevator industry, breakdowns are bad for business. So when Thyssenkrupp North America needed help predicting when to service its lifts, it turned to Microsoft Corp, a partnership that illustrates how Microsoft's chief executive, Satya Nadella, has leveraged the cloud to grow its own business.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','',''); Before that meeting, the company's relationship with Microsoft consisted largely of renewing its license for Windows software. Since then, Thyssenkrupp North America's spending with Microsoft has more than doubled, CEO Patrick Bass told Reuters. ""Our IT spend as a whole total is going down, and yet our capabilities and our total spend with Microsoft have substantially increased."" Leveraging the cloud to enlarge its relationship with customers like Thyssenkrupp has been a key to Nadella's strategy, and it has paid off: Microsoft shares are up 180 percent since Nadella took over, and its market cap edged above $800 billion for the first time earlier this month. When it reports earnings on Thursday, the tech giant is once again expected to post banner results, fueled by its fast-growing Office 365 productivity suite subscription service and the Azure cloud computing business. Its work with Thyssenkrupp illustrates the success Microsoft has had in moving from its traditional licensing model to an emphasis on partnerships and subscription-based cloud-computing products and services. Bass said Thyssenkrupp has flagged 26 digitization projects, and today every single one ""has some touch point into the tech platforms of Microsoft."" Thyssenkrupp has ""gone from being a producer of things and a servicer of things to selling things as a service,"" said Sam George, Microsoft director of Azure IoT engineering. ""They've gone through quite a transformation."" George said he has accompanied Nadella on several customer visits. Microsoft has entered similar partnerships with companies including Kroger Co, Starbucks Corp  , Chevron Corp  and Adobe Systems Inc. The company said 75 percent of Fortune 500 companies have at least three Microsoft cloud enterprise services, up from 70 percent having at least two in 2015. Since changing the way it reports revenue in late 2015 to emphasize cloud services, Microsoft has seen its Productivity and Business Processes segment, which includes Office 365, go from declining 3 percent year-over-year in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 to 28 percent growth in the first quarter of 2018. Growth in the company's Intelligent Cloud, which includes Azure, has gone from 8 percent in the 2016 first quarter to 14 percent in the same period this year Most recently, Thyssenkrupp North America has been rolling out the Office 365 productivity suite across all of its businesses while encouraging employees to use Microsoft's Teams collaboration software. It is also using Dynamics 365 as its customer relationship management software of choice. Bass said his company no longer uses private data centers and is on a path to eliminate on-premise computer servers. Already, 50 percent of Thyssenkrupp North America's compute and storage is deployed on Azure, and that is expected to grow to more than two thirds within the next 12 months. Among recent projects he's proud of, Bass highlighted the use of HoloLens, Microsoft's augmented reality glasses and associated Azure software, in Thyssenkrupp's stair lift business. HoloLens lets Thyssenkrupp show customers what a stair chair could look like when installed at home, reducing delivery waits from 12 weeks to less than three weeks, Bass said. ""We are going to leverage the services of the Azure cloud platform to its fullest,"" Bass said.

"     Symantec Corp SYMC  recently introduced its new technology - Email Threat Isolation - in a bid to counter advanced cyber-attacks in a more innovative and effective way.  makeArticleAd();  Reportedly, this technology will protect devices against spear phishing, credential theft, account takeover and ransomware attacks.    Email Threat Isolation quickly detects malicious content and links from emails and quarantines them, substantially reducing the immanent risks of messaging applications.    Notably, malware attacks have increased 36% in the past year with spear phishing rising 55%. One in every six spam emails contain malicious links and about 30% of users open these emails. Also, 40% of U.S. citizens were affected by cyber security issue last year.    The growing sophistication of phishing activities is making it difficult to trace fingerprints of the attackers. It is to address this issue that Symantec dedicatedly worked on and came up with the integrated Email Threat Isolation solution.   Symantec, the Cybersecurity Guru    Symantec is the pioneer of complete and integrated email security solutions with threat isolation technology for enterprise email. It is currently the only vendor to offer innovative solutions to protect customers from today's cloud generation email attacks.

"Reuters  @media screen and (max-device-width: 480px){body{ font-size:30pt !important;}}    By Anna Irrera and Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi NEW YORK/ZURICH, July 19 (Reuters) - Swiss regulators are stepping up efforts to halt an exodus of cryptocurrency projects from the country, after two of only a handful of banks active in the nascent sector shut their doors on it in the last year. The departures, which industry sources fear will continue, mean Switzerland is losing business to offshore rivals including Liechtenstein, Gibraltar and the Cayman Islands, where banks are more welcoming.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','',''); The wealthy Swiss canton of Zug, for example, has been dubbed ""Crypto Valley"", with 200-300 virtual currency entities opening there in recent years. Zug's finance director, Heinz Taennler, says they may leave if the government does not take steps to give them access to the banking system, without which they struggle to function. ""All their banking relationships are going to Liechtenstein,"" he told Reuters. ""These are hundreds of jobs that have been created, and every job is important."" Thomas Moser, an alternate member of the governing board at the Swiss National Bank (SNB), said some cryptocurrency companies had asked the central to intervene. ""They raised concerns about problems with opening bank accounts, which was a worry for them, and asked for help,"" Moser told Reuters. ""I said this was not something the SNB dealt with, but they should speak with FINMA. FINMA, Switzerland's financial market supervisor, has held discussions with the SNB and bankers' association on how to make banks more accessible to cryptocurrency ventures. ""We would not want to close the door on the opportunities that such innovation (cryptocurrencies) might bring,"" Moser added. Providing the legal framework to launch ICOs and for banks to do business with cryptocurrency companies is not easy. The risk of fraud and lack of transparency about who owns cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether have made regulators around the world wary. The United States is among countries that are increasing scrutiny of the sector.   BANKS WARY Swiss banks are urging the authorities to give them more clarity on the rules that apply to cryptocurrency projects before providing services to the market, and at least two important players have withdrawn for now. Zuercher Kantonalbank (ZKB), the fourth largest Swiss bank and one of the few big banks in the world to welcome issuers of cryptocurrencies, has closed the accounts of more than 20 companies in the last year, industry sources told Reuters. A spokesman for ZKB declined to comment on any former or existing clients relationships, but said the bank does not do business with any cryptocurrency groups. Another large Swiss bank kicked out crypto project Smart Valor at around the same time, said a person familiar with the project. The source declined to name the bank. Only a handful of Switzerland's 250 banks ever allowed companies to deposit the cash equivalent of cryptocurrencies raised in ICOs. At least two still do, Reuters has established. But the involvement of a large bank like ZKB helped to establish Switzerland as an early cryptocurrency hub. ZKB and the bank that turned its back on Smart Valor began shutting their doors in October after a management feud severely damaged cryptocurrency project Tezos, which had conducted Zug's largest ICO, entrepreneurs and advisers said.  Swiss banks are worried because some companies that carried out ICOs did not do anti-money laundering (AML) checks on their contributors, industry sources said. This means the banks themselves could fall foul of AML rules.   LIECHTENSTEIN A WINNER ""A cautionary response from Swiss banks resulted in a pause or closure for most projects in the cryptocurrency space,""  said David Henderson, founder of the Swiss Sweetbridge Foundation, set up to conduct blockchain startup Sweetbridge's ICO. Sweetbridge was in the late stages of securing an account with ZKB, but the application was put on hold a few days after the Tezos scandal erupted, Henderson said. The project ultimately decided not to carry out its planned ICO through the Swiss foundation, setting up entities and bank accounts in Gibraltar and Liechtenstein instead. It is difficult for crypto-projects to use the funds they raise through ICOs if they are locked out of the banking system. Funds from ICOs are often originally raised in cryptocurrencies bitcoin and ether, which have limited use as a means of payment in the broader economy. ""I cannot pay salaries because our money is caught up there. We cannot move it,"" said the founder of a Swiss crypto-firm which has had accounts closed at three different banks. The banks have asked the firm to take out its money, but it is unable to do so without first finding another banking relationship, the founder added. At least two Swiss banks are still accepting ICO funds, according to checks by Reuters. These are Banca Zarattini, a small bank in the Italian-language canton Ticino, and Hypothekarbank Lenzburg, a regional lender located between Zurich and Basel, which recently began accepting crypto customers. Banca Zarattini only banks ICO companies with KYC (know-your-customer) and AML procedures that are in compliance with Swiss law, it said. Hypothekarbank Lenzburg said it had started to accept crytocurrency companies and could charge an initial assessment fee of up to 2,500 Swiss francs($2,500). Bank Frick in Liechtenstein has become a popular alternative for Swiss entities struggling to secure accounts. It banks around 160 crypto-enterprises or projects, of which 60 are in the process of setting up an ICO, the bank told Reuters. The bank, however, declined 90 percent of account requests from cryptocurrency companies and only accepts ICOs based onshore in Switzerland or Liechtenstein, it said.   RULES AND REASSURANCES Despite the challenges, Switzerland is working on new rules to reassure banks and encourage them to accept the accounts of cryptocurrency companies. The country has dropped from second place in 2017 to sixth this year in a country ranking of the sum of ICO funds raised,  according to a study published by PwC and the Crypto Valley Association in June. The Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands topped the list. In May, Swiss Finance Minister Ueli Maurer invited FINMA, the central bank and the Swiss Bankers Association (SBA) to a roundtable discussion on bank accounts for cryptocurrencies. After the meeting, the SBA set up a working group to compile a set of checks and conditions that all banks could follow when opening an account for cryptocurrency firms. ""Banks are currently hesitant to open business accounts for companies with particular touchpoints to ICOs and cryptocurrencies - due to risks such as fraud or money laundering,"" SBA said in a statement. Zug finance director Taennler said the aim set out during the meeting, which he attended, was to have a set of FINMA-approved guidelines for assessing prospective cryptocurrency clients by the year-end. FINMA has already issued separate guidelines to spell out how Swiss AML rules and securities regulations apply to various ICOs. But securities rules are less stringent in Switzerland than in the United States, where the Securities and Exchange Commission has toughened its stance on ICOs.  This makes it more risky for banks in Switzerland to be involved with ICO projects which may have raised money from U.S. contributors and could fall under the purview of the SEC. Switzerland's authorities have said they want to create conditions for the country to remain competitive but with no room for scams or financial crime. The finance ministry is also looking at the broader legal framework for blockchain technology and ICOs. Its findings will be presented to the federal government by the end of the year and will determine how the technology fits into existing Swiss laws and regulations.

"    When you were a young'un, your parents may have sat you down   to talk about the ""birds and the bees."" Now it's time to turn the   tables and address another uncomfortable topic: their   finances. Such conversations mark a reversal in the traditional   parent-child dynamic, and also can be fraught with concerns over   independence, trust and mortality. As a result, these talks often   don't happen at all, and a perceived lack of urgency is to blame,   according to a 2018 survey conducted by Wells Fargo. Roughly one-third of parents over the age of 60 say they've   never discussed later-life needs with family, including   inheritance plans, beneficiaries, important documents or   designated representatives, according to the survey. Meanwhile,   adult children worry such conversations will cause conflict or   make it seem as though they're after their parents' money.makeArticleAd(); As daunting as it may seem, it's important to have ""the talk""   about finances with your parents to help protect them from scams   and elder abuse, which cost Americans more than $36 billion each   year, according to financial services firm True Link Financial.   These conversations also ensure that a rapid-response plan is in   place in the event of disability and that there are no surprises   after your parents die, says Ron Long, head of regulatory affairs   and elder client initiatives at Wells Fargo Advisors. These four tips can open lines of communication. 1. Start with one conversation When's a good time to sit your parents down for a hard   conversation about their financial well-being, plans for the   future and important legal and financial documents like a will,   power of attorney or health care directives? The twelfth of   never, for most children. Don't wait for tragedy to strike. A study by Ameriprise   Financial found that a life-altering incident was the trigger for   90% of children who'd actually discussed estate planning with   their parents.  » Unfamiliar with estate planning?     See our   7-step checklist  Instead, carve out time for a family meeting - perhaps on   Mother's Day, Father's Day or the Friday after Thanksgiving -   when all the children are present, Long recommends. ""It's a good   way to get the conversation started and then you can do a   refresher or update down the road."" The first conversation should serve as a door-opener. There   are weighty decisions at play - which may change over time with   your parents' mental or physical health - so don't expect a   one-and-done conversation. 2. Begin with the basics Talking about money inspires reactions ranging from secretive   to forthright. Even if your parents aren't particularly prickly   about discussing their finances, it's prudent to ease into such   conversations.

Think   less interrogative (how much money's at stake and who gets what?)   and more collaborative (exchanging information about where   accounts are held or who has power of attorney). 3. Broach serious topics Once you've established a rapport, tackle topics that make   either you or your parents uncomfortable, including the morose   (funeral arrangements or declining health) and the dangerous   (financial scams targeting seniors that could wipe out their   savings). Don't let the prospect of an awkward conversation now create a   bigger headache in the future. Strive for this balance:   confronting reality head-on without infantilizing or offending   your parents. A bad way to deal? Shutting down future   conversations when talks are strained.

"    When you were a young'un, your parents may have sat you down   to talk about the ""birds and the bees."" Now it's time to turn the   tables and address another uncomfortable topic: their   finances. Such conversations mark a reversal in the traditional   parent-child dynamic, and also can be fraught with concerns over   independence, trust and mortality. As a result, these talks often   don't happen at all, and a perceived lack of urgency is to blame,   according to a 2018 survey conducted by Wells Fargo. Roughly one-third of parents over the age of 60 say they've   never discussed later-life needs with family, including   inheritance plans, beneficiaries, important documents or   designated representatives, according to the survey. Meanwhile,   adult children worry such conversations will cause conflict or   make it seem as though they're after their parents' money.makeArticleAd(); As daunting as it may seem, it's important to have ""the talk""   about finances with your parents to help protect them from scams   and elder abuse, which cost Americans more than $36 billion each   year, according to financial services firm True Link Financial.   These conversations also ensure that a rapid-response plan is in   place in the event of disability and that there are no surprises   after your parents die, says Ron Long, head of regulatory affairs   and elder client initiatives at Wells Fargo Advisors. These four tips can open lines of communication. 1. Start with one conversation When's a good time to sit your parents down for a hard   conversation about their financial well-being, plans for the   future and important legal and financial documents like a will,   power of attorney or health care directives? The twelfth of   never, for most children. Don't wait for tragedy to strike. A study by Ameriprise   Financial found that a life-altering incident was the trigger for   90% of children who'd actually discussed estate planning with   their parents.  » Unfamiliar with estate planning?     See our   7-step checklist  Instead, carve out time for a family meeting - perhaps on   Mother's Day, Father's Day or the Friday after Thanksgiving -   when all the children are present, Long recommends. ""It's a good   way to get the conversation started and then you can do a   refresher or update down the road."" The first conversation should serve as a door-opener. There   are weighty decisions at play - which may change over time with   your parents' mental or physical health - so don't expect a   one-and-done conversation. 2. Begin with the basics Talking about money inspires reactions ranging from secretive   to forthright. Even if your parents aren't particularly prickly   about discussing their finances, it's prudent to ease into such   conversations. Long says a strategy that's ""very helpful"" is approaching   discussions from a group-planning perspective - sharing what   end-of-life goals you're considering and asking your parents   about theirs. ""Remember, these are subjects that a lot of older   folks hold close to their hearts,"" he says. Be sensitive when starting that initial conversation.

"Dividend investing is a simple way to accumulate wealth over   the long term, especially when investors leverage the power of   compounding by reinvesting their dividends. Income investors   often focus on high-yielding stocks in the real estate, telecom,   and energy sectors -- but there are also plenty of great dividend   plays in the tech sector. Let's examine four income-generating   tech stocks that belong in your portfolio.   Image source: Getty Images. makeArticleAd(); Cisco  Cisco    (NASDAQ: CSCO) is the largest manufacturer of network routers and   switches in the world. Those are slow-growth businesses, but   Cisco has been working to diversify its portfolio with   cybersecurity products, wireless services, and collaboration   software. Cisco currently pays a forward dividend yield of 3.1%. It   spent just 46% of its free cash flow (FCF) on that payout over   the past 12 months, and it has raised the dividend annually for   seven straight years. Analysts expect its earnings to grow 8%   this year, and the stock trades at a reasonable 15 times forward   earnings. Cisco also recently repatriated   $67 billion    in overseas cash, which will be applied toward buybacks,   dividends, and domestic acquisitions. Those moves should tighten   up its valuation, attract more income investors, and widen its   competitive moat. IBM  IBM    (NYSE: IBM) is a diversified tech company that offers IT   services, business software, mainframes, and cloud services. IBM   has been investing heavily in the growth of five ""strategic   imperatives"" -- its cloud, mobile, security, analytics, and   social units -- to offset the slower growth of its legacy IT   services and business software businesses. IBM recently broke a six-year streak of revenue declines with   two straight quarters of sales growth. During the first quarter   of 2018, IBM reported that its strategic imperatives revenue grew   12% annually over the past 12 months and accounted for 47%   of its total revenue. Analysts expect IBM's earnings to grow just   1% this year, but the stock looks cheap at 10 times forward   earnings. More importantly, IBM's forward dividend yield of 4.4% should   limit the stock's downside potential. Big Blue spent 41% of its   FCF on that payout over the past 12 months, and it has raised its   dividend annually for over two decades.   Image source: Getty Images. Qualcomm  Qualcomm    (NASDAQ: QCOM) is the largest mobile chipmaker in the world. It   generates most of its revenue from mobile chipset sales, but it   makes most of its profits from licensing its wireless patents.   The company expanded into custom chips for wearables, connected   cars, and other devices in recent years, and is currently trying   to acquire   NXP Semiconductors    to become the world's top automotive chipmaker. Qualcomm currently faces probes and lawsuits from regulators   and original equipment manufacturers, which claim that its   licensing fees are too high. Its bid for NXP also faces an   uncertain outcome    due to the low percentage of tendered shares. Those   headwinds are expected to cause Qualcomm's earnings to tumble 24%   this year before rebounding next year. Qualcomm's stock might not seem like a bargain at 17 times   forward earnings, but its 4.3% forward yield could set a floor   under the stock. Qualcomm spent 91% of its FCF on that dividend   over the past 12 months, and it's raised that payout annually   since 2003. Seagate  Seagate    (NASDAQ: STX) is the world's second largest maker of HDDs   (hard disk drives). HDDs have been losing ground to SSDs (solid   state drives) in recent years in the consumer market, but demand   for HDDs in data centers -- which prioritize storage capacity   over raw speed -- remains high. Instead of aggressively diversifying into SSDs, Seagate's main   focus is to boost the capacity of its HDDs for those customers.   That strategy helped Seagate sidestep the flash memory shortages   and price hikes that are hurting other device makers. The company   only has a limited presence in the SSD market. Analysts expect Seagate's earnings to grow 29%, and another 4%   next year. The stock trades at just 11 times forward earnings,   and it pays a forward yield of 4.3%. That dividend, which has   been hiked annually for seven straight years, used up just 48% of   Seagate's FCF over the past 12 months.   10 stocks we like better than Qualcomm       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

"    After prolonged sluggishness, PC shipments reported solid growth in second-quarter 2018, according to latest data from two independent research firms - Gartner and International Data Corporation (""IDC"")  makeArticleAd();  As expected, the firms provided different figures, which is mainly due to different techniques used for tracking PC sales as well as the inclusion and/or exclusion of certain products.    For example, IDC includes Chromebooks, which run on Alphabet Inc.'s GOOGL  Chrome operating system, while Gartner takes into account Microsoft MSFT  tablets and ""detachables"" such as the iPad Pro and the Asus Transformer.   Top Vendors    Preliminary data released by Gartner displayed that PC shipments in the second quarter were up 1.4% year over year to 62.1 million units. The IDC report stated that PC shipments increased 2.7% from the year-ago period to approximately 62.3 million units, surpassing its expectation of 0.3% increase.    Gartner called it ""the first quarter of year-over-year global PC shipment growth since the first quarter of 2012."" IDC echoed the same sentiment saying that PC shipment ""marks the strongest year-on-year growth rate in more than six years.""    Both the firms believe that the improved PC shipment results were mainly driven by higher demand in business markets due to migration to Windows 10.    However, per the data compiled by Gartner, weak demand for consumer PCs remained an overhang. Shift in consumer behavior from using PCs to smartphones for regular work continues to impact PC's market growth. IDC stated that despite the shift to mobility, desktop market contributed positively to the results.    Per Gartner, Lenovo and Hewlett-Packard HPQ  held the leading position with 21.9% market share each, followed by Dell, Apple AAPL  and Acer with 16.8%, 7.1% and 6.4% share, respectively.    According to IDC, HP was the clear winner with 23.9% market share. Lenovo and Dell held the second and third position with respective market share of 22.1% and 18.1%. While Apple held the fourth position with 6.9% share, Acer occupied the fifth spot with 6.7% share.    Computer - Mini computers Industry 5YR %     Return      Computer - Mini computers Industry 5YR %     Return   Region-Wise Performance    United States showed year-over-year improvement per both the research firms. Per Gartner, U.S. PC shipments of 14.5 million rose 1.7% year over year, returning to growth after six straight disappointing quarters of decline.    Per IDC, the United States recorded the second consecutive year-over-year improvement in PC shipments to 17.3 million units. The upside was attributed to increase in desktop sales backed by rising commercial purchases and growing demand for gaming systems.    Gartner estimated that PC shipments rose 1.3% to 17.4 million units in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA). Increasing consumer demand in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan backed results. Strong demand for business PCs in Germany and the United Kingdom was also a tailwind. IDC notes that the modest growth of PC market in EMEA was led by renewals in the commercial space.    Per Gartner, the Asia Pacific region's PC shipment totaled 21.3 million units, showing 0.1% year-over-year increase. However, the China market remained a concern. Gartner states that unit shipments declined 3.6% from the year-ago period, given the saturation in consumer market and the deferred business procurements.    IDC noted that positive demand from India drove Asia/Pacific (excluding Japan) (APeJ) region. Philippines also recorded good shipments owing to the project by the Department of Education.  The firm stated that China's PC market exceeded expectations on the back of higher consumer notebooks sale. However, weak demand from SMBs and public sector impacted shipments in the commercial segment.    In Japan, the PC industry continued to display strength backed by desktop and notebooks, according to IDC.   Bottom Line    The positive comments on the PC market by the two industry experts will provide a respite to not just PC vendors, but also the companies dependent on the industry.    An improving trend in PC shipments benefits the business prospects of companies like HP Inc., Microsoft, Intel INTC  , Seagate Technologies STX  and Western Digital WDC  , which continue to depend substantially on PC sales.    However, a note of caution is evident from Gartner as the firm chose not to ""declare a PC industry recovery"" owing to the unstable market environment. Moreover, with the passage of Microsoft's Window's 10 replacement cycle, the demand from the business circle is anticipated to weaken, which poses a concern for these companies.

"What happened  Shares of hard-drive giant   Seagate Technology    (NASDAQ: STX) rose 35% higher in the first half of 2018,      according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence    . It's been a bumpy ride, with most of the action taking place in   the first three months of the new year.   Image source: Getty Images. makeArticleAd(); So what  Share prices jumped 7% higher in early   January    on rumors that Seagate had made a large investment in the company   behind the Ripple cryptocurrency. That speculation turned out to   be on target, and Seagate kept the fires burning with a strong   second-quarter report later that month. All told,   Seagate investors enjoyed a 32% return in January   alone    . The next earnings report was less impressive, causing Seagate   shares to   plunge 8%    on May 1. But that move largely disappears from a longer-term   perspective, lost in a sea of jagged gains and drops that work   out to a pretty smooth and stable moving average overall. Now what The company is leaning heavily on its enterprise-grade   products, which bundle very large storage capacities with long   warranty periods and reasonably low prices. Super-fast   solid-state storage devices are stealing a lot of market share   from these old-school packs of spinning magnetic disks, but   there's still a place for the reliability and lower prices per   gigabyte that Seagate's favorite products can offer. I'm not sure that this is a sustainable idea for the long term   since solid-state memory chips are becoming cheaper and cheaper.   Eventually, Seagate must come up with a better long-haul   strategy. I would much rather own archrival   Western Digital    (NASDAQ: WDC) and its more future-proof business model until   Seagate gets its solid-state future sorted out.

"We're just over halfway through 2018, so it's a good time to   take a step back and look at how investments have performed so   far this year. As far as high-   dividend   stocks    go, many have been under significant pressure thanks to rising   interest rates. In fact, high-dividend stocks have underperformed   the   S&P 500    by more than 4 percentage points, as a group. With that in mind, here are the five best-performing   high-dividend stocks (defined as yields of 3% or more) on the   S&P 500 through the first six months of 2018, followed by a   brief discussion of why they've done so well.

Prices, yields, and total returns as of July 9, 2018. For some retailers, things aren't as bad as they may have   looked Many retail stocks had been beaten down tremendously in 2017,   as investors worried about the ""retail apocalypse."" While this   certainly made sense given the wave of high-profile retail   bankruptcies of recent years, it appears that the fears were   overblown for certain retailers. You can see two good examples of this in the chart: Macy's and   Kohls. Both are among the S&P 500's top performers so far in   2018, and have returned 68% and 93%, respectively, over the past   year.       M Total Return Price    data by   YCharts    . Kohl's has produced some impressive returns recently. As my   colleague Adam Levine-Weinberg pointed out in a   recent episode    of the   Industry Focus    podcast, it was Kohl's 6.3% comparable sales increase during the   fourth quarter that was really the key to the stock's rally, and   sales figures have continued to look impressive since then.   Macy's has also seen comps grow, with a 4.2% increase in the   first quarter. Simply put, it looks like some of these retailers' turnaround   initiatives have been working, such as Macy's expanded loyalty   program. And there could be more growth ahead with the company's   omnichannel efforts to grow in-store pickup and ship-to-store   sales. Not to be outdone, Kohl's is developing an ""if you can't   beat 'em, join 'em"" attitude when it comes to   Amazon.com    (NASDAQ: AMZN) , and is testing a partnership with the e-commerce   giant to accept Amazon returns in certain Kohl's locations, with   the goal of creating more foot traffic in their stores. The hard-drive business is doing well Seagate is another company that has performed incredibly well   this year, as demand for storage seems to be trending upward. In   the most recent quarter, Seagate shipped 87.4 exabytes of   hard-drive capacity, a 33% increase over the previous year. A big driver of this is increased enterprise business --   specifically, the growth of data centers in recent years.   Enterprise customers now make up 44% of Seagate's revenue, up by   700 basis points over the past two years. And as I've written   before in reference to   data center real estate investment trust Digital Realty    (NYSE: DLR) , the need for data storage doesn't appear to be   slowing down anytime soon. One of the top-performing energy stocks ONEOK is a midstream energy company -- which essentially means   that they transport energy products, particularly natural gas.   ONEOK has one of the largest natural gas pipeline systems in the   U.S. and is investing considerable money in planned   expansion projects    , with about $4 billion of growth projects announced over the   past year or so. Not only is ONEOK one of the highest-dividend companies in the   S&P 500, but the company has an ambitious goal of increasing   its dividend at a 9% to 11% pace over the next several years,   fueled by the aforementioned expansion projects. A utility in the top performers? It may seem odd to see a utility stock like Ohio-based   FirstEnergy in the list of highest-performing stocks, since not   only are utilities generally considered low-volatility safe   stocks but because many high-dividend utilities have been under   pressure as interest rates have risen. However, FirstEnergy's recent results were enough to cause the   stock's impressive rally. The company's revenue has increased   during the past two quarters, reversing a nearly two-year   decline, and earnings soared. Also, FirstEnergy's profit margin   was the highest it's been in nine years.   10 stocks we like better than Macy's       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

"     International Business Machines IBM  has collaborated with Banca Carige, an Italian bank, to introduced Dock, a $0.5 billion U.S. joint venture agreement. Based in Genoa, Italy, Banca Carige seeks to enhance financial processes by improving competitiveness across its branches and overall clientele.  makeArticleAd();  IBM's innovative capabilities comprising artificial intelligence (""AI""), big data, cognitive and analytics offerings will assist Banca Carige to digitally transform its processes. The new technologies will eventually aid the Italian banking group achieve the desired business goals. Dock presently employs 173 professionals, comprising 133 people from Banca Carige and the rest from IBM.    Additionally, the tech giant also entered into an AU$1 billion (estimated to be $740 million) deal with the Australian government to become its technology partner. Per the five-year deal, IBM's advanced AI, Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, cloud, quantum computing and cross-brand capabilities will be leveraged by different Australian Government agencies.    Both the deal wins strengthen the company's growth prospects in the digital transformation space. Per a MarketsandMarkets report, digital transformation market is envisioned to grow at a CAGR of 19.1% to $493.39 billion by 2022 from $205.99 billion in 2017. As a result, IBM seems well-positioned to capitalize on projected growth. The report only reinforces our belief that IBM's services hold immense potential.       We note that IBM's stock has lost 3.6% in the past year, against the industry  's rally of 1.0%.   Partnership with Banca Carige    Notably, the deal was signed in the first quarter of 2018. This partnership will aid in simplifying the bank's IT infrastructure, aid digital transformation processes, consequently enhancing client experience. In fact, Banca Carige aims to bring about a single bank model. Digital banking, cloud storage, cost optimization, leveraging robotics and enhancing financial advisory processes remain other focal points.    According to Enrico Cereda, President and CEO of IBM Italy, ""With this new alliance, a path is born that leads the banking sector towards a future full of new professional skills and opportunities offered today by innovation and technological progress."" Cereda further added, ""Italia is proud to accompany one of the country's oldest financial institutions along the path of digital transformation.""   IBM's Deal to Assist Australian Government    Australia aims to provide its citizens with ""one of the top-three"" digital government infrastructures, by 2025. In a bid to realize this goal, Australian government will leverage both IBM's hardware and software at various levels to optimize their respective processes. Apart from the leading Digital Transformation Agency (""DTA""), other agencies utilizing IBM's solutions will be the Department of Defence (""DOD""), the Department of Home Affairs (""DHA""), to mention a few.    IBM's 'Building Digital Capability' tools and related resources will be made accessible across departments. The focal point is to establish robust security solutions to ensure safety of citizen data from advanced cyber-security threats. Australian government is estimated to save approximately AU$100 million from the deal, which is effective immediately through June 2023.    We believe this is major win for the company given its unpleasant past association with the Australian government. The renewed ties are likely to augur well in the long haul.   Our Take    IBM has been a pioneer when it comes to helping businesses and governments to digitally transform and evolve. The tech giant continues to bring innovation to services to help the enterprises, government agencies, leverage the emerging technologies, including the likes of cloud, AI, IoT, among others.    IBM's advanced capabilities makes its offerings well poised to gain robust adoption. The traction witnessed by the company's services will bolster the top line.    We believe the ongoing deal wins with its notable customer base will eventually aid IBM in competing against peers.   Zacks Rank & Key Picks    IBM currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).    Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Seagate STX  , Mellanox MLNX  and Micron MU  , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here   .

"     For Immediate Release  Chicago, IL - July 5, 2018 - Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Computer - Storage Devices, including NetApp, Inc. NTAP  , Super Micro Computer, Inc. SMCI  and Seagate Technology PLC STX  . Industry: Computer - Storage Devices Link:  https://www.zacks.com/commentary/170214/computer-storage-devices-stock-outlook-growth-guaranteed  The Computer - Storage Devices industry is witnessing an exponential rise on widespread use of streaming media, cloud storage solutions, cloud-based apps, data virtualization and other data-intensive chores. The key driving force of the worldwide storage devices market is its increasing use in mobile devices that have now higher memory capacities. Rampant growth in the amount of data, complexity of data formats and the need to scale resources at regular intervals have compelled several companies to turn to storage devices vendors. This represents significant growth opportunity for the industry players. As consumers' dependence on cloud for storage purpose increases, a proportionate rise in demand for cloud-dedicated data centers is inevitable. Also, with simultaneous increase in data volumes, demand for cloud-based storage systems in data centers is likely to grow significantly. Extensive implementations of CRM solutions, increased Internet and mobile penetration, rapidly growing media and regulatory compliance have resulted in data explosion for enterprises. Now, these enterprises are realizing the importance of storing information which, in turn should favor growth. Banking on the rise of connected devices, the Internet of Things (IoT), virtual reality (VR), and artificial intelligence (AI), the Computer - Storage Devices industry remains a lucrative investment opportunity.  Industry Offers Solid Shareholder Returns  The Zacks Computer-Storage Devices  Industry, within the broader Zacks Computer And Technology Sector  , has outperformed both the S&P 500 and its own sector over the past year. While the stocks in this industry have collectively gained 27.5%, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Computer And Technology Sector have rallied 12.5% and 19.2%, respectively. The secular growth of digital data and higher demand for storage especially for SSDs, contributed to the performance of both the sector and the S&P 500.  Sector Stocks Trading Cheap  Owing to the strong fundamentals of the industry over the past year, the valuation looks attractive. One might get a good sense of the industry's relative valuation by looking at its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), which is the most appropriate multiple for valuing Computer - Storage Devices stocks because their earnings are effective in gauging performance.     Generally, the price of a stock rallies on a rise in earnings. As forecasts for expected earnings move higher, demand for the stock should drive its price. If the P/E of a stock is rising steadily, it means that investors are pinning their hopes on the company's inherent strength. This ratio essentially measures a stock's current market value relative to its earnings performance. Investors believe that the lower the P/E, the higher will be the value of the stock. The industry currently has a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 11.58, near the lowest level over the past year and below the median level of 12.15. Clearly, there is plenty of upside left. The space also looks quite inexpensive when compared with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month P/E ratio for the S&P 500 is 19.9 and the median level is 20.17.  Outperformance to Continue on Robust Earnings   Outlook  Robust market adoption of cloud computing, big data, IoT, auto, connected devices, VR, and AI will continue to drive the industry and have encouraged many companies to raise their projections for the current fiscal year. This optimism is likely to help Computer - Storage Devices stocks generate positive shareholder returns in the near future. But what really matters to investors is whether this group has the potential to perform better than the broader market in the quarters ahead. The earlier valuation discussion shows that market participants have been willing to pay up for these stocks already, potentially limiting further upside from current levels. One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry's prospects for a solid price performance going forward is its earnings outlook. Empirical research shows that earnings outlook for the industry, a reflection of the earnings revisions trend for the constituent companies, has a direct bearing on its stock market performance. The Price & Consensus chart for the industry shows the market's evolving bottom-up earnings expectations for the industry and its aggregate stock market performance. The red line in the chart represents the Zacks measure of consensus earnings expectations for 2019, while the light blue line represents the same for 2018. This becomes even clearer when we focus on the aggregate bottom-up EPS revisions trend. The chart below shows the evolution of aggregate consensus expectations for 2018. Please note that the $4.70 EPS estimate for the industry for 2018 is not the actual bottom-up EPS estimate for every company in the Zacks Computer - Storage Devices industry, but rather an illustrative aggregate number created by our proprietary analytics model. The key factor to keep in mind is not the earnings per share of the industry for 2018, but how this estimate has evolved recently.  The consensus earnings per share estimate for the Zacks Computer - Storage Devices industry reflects solid year-over-year improvement.Moreover, the trend in earnings estimates revisions have been favorable of late. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that sell-side analysts are gaining confidence in this group's earnings potential. The consensus EPS estimate for the current fiscal year has been revised 7.8% upward since Mar 31, 2018.  Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Robust Prospects  The group's Zacks Industry Rank  , which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued outperformance in the near term. The Zacks Computer - Storage Devices industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #17, which places it at the top 7% of more than 256 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.  Computer - Storage Devices Stocks Promise Long-Term   Growth  The long-term prospects for the industry are alluring. When compared with the broader Zacks S&P 500 composite, the long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth estimate for the Zacks Computer - Storage Devices industry appears promising. The group's mean estimate of long-term EPS growth rate has shown signs of improvement since mid-April 2018 to reach the current level of 15.25%. This compares to 9.8% for the Zacks S&P 500 composite. Moreover, the growing demand of data storage, information security, virtualization, analytics and cloud computing to store, manage, protect, and analyze data are some of the incredible business drivers. These factors are expected to drive growth in top line that has gained significant momentum since the end of 2016. In fact, the basis of this long-terms EPS growth could be another reason for the steady top line growth that the Zacks Computer - Storage Devices industry has witnessed since 2016. Moreover, another indication of solid long-term prospects is the improvement in the group's gross margin.  Bottom Line  This is a great place to invest in right now, both with respect to the near term and the longer term. Factors like an improving unit revenue scenario, increased demand for connected devices, cheap valuation and growing need for improved data storage to eliminating data portability issues are positives for the sector and might contribute to long-term growth. Keeping these factors in mind, investors may look for some good entry points in the stocks that will help them make the most of the momentum in the industry. Here, we list three stocks that have been witnessing positive earnings estimate revisions and carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). (You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here  .)  NetApp, Inc.  : The company has been seeing positive revisions in earnings estimates over the last 60 days.

"Reuters  @media screen and (max-device-width: 480px){body{ font-size:30pt !important;}}    By Anna Irrera and Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi NEW YORK/ZURICH, July 19 (Reuters) - Swiss regulators are stepping up efforts to halt an exodus of cryptocurrency projects from the country, after two of only a handful of banks active in the nascent sector shut their doors on it in the last year. The departures, which industry sources fear will continue, mean Switzerland is losing business to offshore rivals including Liechtenstein, Gibraltar and the Cayman Islands, where banks are more welcoming.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','',''); The wealthy Swiss canton of Zug, for example, has been dubbed ""Crypto Valley"", with 200-300 virtual currency entities opening there in recent years. Zug's finance director, Heinz Taennler, says they may leave if the government does not take steps to give them access to the banking system, without which they struggle to function. ""All their banking relationships are going to Liechtenstein,"" he told Reuters. ""These are hundreds of jobs that have been created, and every job is important."" Thomas Moser, an alternate member of the governing board at the Swiss National Bank (SNB), said some cryptocurrency companies had asked the central to intervene. ""They raised concerns about problems with opening bank accounts, which was a worry for them, and asked for help,"" Moser told Reuters. ""I said this was not something the SNB dealt with, but they should speak with FINMA. FINMA, Switzerland's financial market supervisor, has held discussions with the SNB and bankers' association on how to make banks more accessible to cryptocurrency ventures. ""We would not want to close the door on the opportunities that such innovation (cryptocurrencies) might bring,"" Moser added. Providing the legal framework to launch ICOs and for banks to do business with cryptocurrency companies is not easy. The risk of fraud and lack of transparency about who owns cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether have made regulators around the world wary. The United States is among countries that are increasing scrutiny of the sector.   BANKS WARY Swiss banks are urging the authorities to give them more clarity on the rules that apply to cryptocurrency projects before providing services to the market, and at least two important players have withdrawn for now. Zuercher Kantonalbank (ZKB), the fourth largest Swiss bank and one of the few big banks in the world to welcome issuers of cryptocurrencies, has closed the accounts of more than 20 companies in the last year, industry sources told Reuters. A spokesman for ZKB declined to comment on any former or existing clients relationships, but said the bank does not do business with any cryptocurrency groups. Another large Swiss bank kicked out crypto project Smart Valor at around the same time, said a person familiar with the project. The source declined to name the bank. Only a handful of Switzerland's 250 banks ever allowed companies to deposit the cash equivalent of cryptocurrencies raised in ICOs. At least two still do, Reuters has established. But the involvement of a large bank like ZKB helped to establish Switzerland as an early cryptocurrency hub. ZKB and the bank that turned its back on Smart Valor began shutting their doors in October after a management feud severely damaged cryptocurrency project Tezos, which had conducted Zug's largest ICO, entrepreneurs and advisers said.  Swiss banks are worried because some companies that carried out ICOs did not do anti-money laundering (AML) checks on their contributors, industry sources said. This means the banks themselves could fall foul of AML rules.   LIECHTENSTEIN A WINNER ""A cautionary response from Swiss banks resulted in a pause or closure for most projects in the cryptocurrency space,""  said David Henderson, founder of the Swiss Sweetbridge Foundation, set up to conduct blockchain startup Sweetbridge's ICO. Sweetbridge was in the late stages of securing an account with ZKB, but the application was put on hold a few days after the Tezos scandal erupted, Henderson said. The project ultimately decided not to carry out its planned ICO through the Swiss foundation, setting up entities and bank accounts in Gibraltar and Liechtenstein instead. It is difficult for crypto-projects to use the funds they raise through ICOs if they are locked out of the banking system. Funds from ICOs are often originally raised in cryptocurrencies bitcoin and ether, which have limited use as a means of payment in the broader economy. ""I cannot pay salaries because our money is caught up there. We cannot move it,"" said the founder of a Swiss crypto-firm which has had accounts closed at three different banks. The banks have asked the firm to take out its money, but it is unable to do so without first finding another banking relationship, the founder added. At least two Swiss banks are still accepting ICO funds, according to checks by Reuters. These are Banca Zarattini, a small bank in the Italian-language canton Ticino, and Hypothekarbank Lenzburg, a regional lender located between Zurich and Basel, which recently began accepting crypto customers. Banca Zarattini only banks ICO companies with KYC (know-your-customer) and AML procedures that are in compliance with Swiss law, it said. Hypothekarbank Lenzburg said it had started to accept crytocurrency companies and could charge an initial assessment fee of up to 2,500 Swiss francs($2,500). Bank Frick in Liechtenstein has become a popular alternative for Swiss entities struggling to secure accounts. It banks around 160 crypto-enterprises or projects, of which 60 are in the process of setting up an ICO, the bank told Reuters. The bank, however, declined 90 percent of account requests from cryptocurrency companies and only accepts ICOs based onshore in Switzerland or Liechtenstein, it said.   RULES AND REASSURANCES Despite the challenges, Switzerland is working on new rules to reassure banks and encourage them to accept the accounts of cryptocurrency companies. The country has dropped from second place in 2017 to sixth this year in a country ranking of the sum of ICO funds raised,  according to a study published by PwC and the Crypto Valley Association in June. The Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands topped the list. In May, Swiss Finance Minister Ueli Maurer invited FINMA, the central bank and the Swiss Bankers Association (SBA) to a roundtable discussion on bank accounts for cryptocurrencies. After the meeting, the SBA set up a working group to compile a set of checks and conditions that all banks could follow when opening an account for cryptocurrency firms. ""Banks are currently hesitant to open business accounts for companies with particular touchpoints to ICOs and cryptocurrencies - due to risks such as fraud or money laundering,"" SBA said in a statement. Zug finance director Taennler said the aim set out during the meeting, which he attended, was to have a set of FINMA-approved guidelines for assessing prospective cryptocurrency clients by the year-end.

"Reuters  @media screen and (max-device-width: 480px){body{ font-size:30pt !important;}}    By Anna Irrera and Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi NEW YORK/ZURICH, July 19 (Reuters) - Swiss regulators are stepping up efforts to halt an exodus of cryptocurrency projects from the country, after two of only a handful of banks active in the nascent sector shut their doors on it in the last year. The departures, which industry sources fear will continue, mean Switzerland is losing business to offshore rivals including Liechtenstein, Gibraltar and the Cayman Islands, where banks are more welcoming.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','',''); The wealthy Swiss canton of Zug, for example, has been dubbed ""Crypto Valley"", with 200-300 virtual currency entities opening there in recent years. Zug's finance director, Heinz Taennler, says they may leave if the government does not take steps to give them access to the banking system, without which they struggle to function. ""All their banking relationships are going to Liechtenstein,"" he told Reuters. ""These are hundreds of jobs that have been created, and every job is important."" Thomas Moser, an alternate member of the governing board at the Swiss National Bank (SNB), said some cryptocurrency companies had asked the central to intervene. ""They raised concerns about problems with opening bank accounts, which was a worry for them, and asked for help,"" Moser told Reuters. ""I said this was not something the SNB dealt with, but they should speak with FINMA. FINMA, Switzerland's financial market supervisor, has held discussions with the SNB and bankers' association on how to make banks more accessible to cryptocurrency ventures. ""We would not want to close the door on the opportunities that such innovation (cryptocurrencies) might bring,"" Moser added. Providing the legal framework to launch ICOs and for banks to do business with cryptocurrency companies is not easy. The risk of fraud and lack of transparency about who owns cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether have made regulators around the world wary. The United States is among countries that are increasing scrutiny of the sector.   BANKS WARY Swiss banks are urging the authorities to give them more clarity on the rules that apply to cryptocurrency projects before providing services to the market, and at least two important players have withdrawn for now. Zuercher Kantonalbank (ZKB), the fourth largest Swiss bank and one of the few big banks in the world to welcome issuers of cryptocurrencies, has closed the accounts of more than 20 companies in the last year, industry sources told Reuters. A spokesman for ZKB declined to comment on any former or existing clients relationships, but said the bank does not do business with any cryptocurrency groups. Another large Swiss bank kicked out crypto project Smart Valor at around the same time, said a person familiar with the project. The source declined to name the bank. Only a handful of Switzerland's 250 banks ever allowed companies to deposit the cash equivalent of cryptocurrencies raised in ICOs. At least two still do, Reuters has established. But the involvement of a large bank like ZKB helped to establish Switzerland as an early cryptocurrency hub. ZKB and the bank that turned its back on Smart Valor began shutting their doors in October after a management feud severely damaged cryptocurrency project Tezos, which had conducted Zug's largest ICO, entrepreneurs and advisers said.  Swiss banks are worried because some companies that carried out ICOs did not do anti-money laundering (AML) checks on their contributors, industry sources said. This means the banks themselves could fall foul of AML rules.   LIECHTENSTEIN A WINNER ""A cautionary response from Swiss banks resulted in a pause or closure for most projects in the cryptocurrency space,""  said David Henderson, founder of the Swiss Sweetbridge Foundation, set up to conduct blockchain startup Sweetbridge's ICO. Sweetbridge was in the late stages of securing an account with ZKB, but the application was put on hold a few days after the Tezos scandal erupted, Henderson said. The project ultimately decided not to carry out its planned ICO through the Swiss foundation, setting up entities and bank accounts in Gibraltar and Liechtenstein instead. It is difficult for crypto-projects to use the funds they raise through ICOs if they are locked out of the banking system. Funds from ICOs are often originally raised in cryptocurrencies bitcoin and ether, which have limited use as a means of payment in the broader economy. ""I cannot pay salaries because our money is caught up there. We cannot move it,"" said the founder of a Swiss crypto-firm which has had accounts closed at three different banks. The banks have asked the firm to take out its money, but it is unable to do so without first finding another banking relationship, the founder added. At least two Swiss banks are still accepting ICO funds, according to checks by Reuters. These are Banca Zarattini, a small bank in the Italian-language canton Ticino, and Hypothekarbank Lenzburg, a regional lender located between Zurich and Basel, which recently began accepting crypto customers. Banca Zarattini only banks ICO companies with KYC (know-your-customer) and AML procedures that are in compliance with Swiss law, it said. Hypothekarbank Lenzburg said it had started to accept crytocurrency companies and could charge an initial assessment fee of up to 2,500 Swiss francs($2,500). Bank Frick in Liechtenstein has become a popular alternative for Swiss entities struggling to secure accounts. It banks around 160 crypto-enterprises or projects, of which 60 are in the process of setting up an ICO, the bank told Reuters. The bank, however, declined 90 percent of account requests from cryptocurrency companies and only accepts ICOs based onshore in Switzerland or Liechtenstein, it said.   RULES AND REASSURANCES Despite the challenges, Switzerland is working on new rules to reassure banks and encourage them to accept the accounts of cryptocurrency companies. The country has dropped from second place in 2017 to sixth this year in a country ranking of the sum of ICO funds raised,  according to a study published by PwC and the Crypto Valley Association in June. The Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands topped the list. In May, Swiss Finance Minister Ueli Maurer invited FINMA, the central bank and the Swiss Bankers Association (SBA) to a roundtable discussion on bank accounts for cryptocurrencies. After the meeting, the SBA set up a working group to compile a set of checks and conditions that all banks could follow when opening an account for cryptocurrency firms. ""Banks are currently hesitant to open business accounts for companies with particular touchpoints to ICOs and cryptocurrencies - due to risks such as fraud or money laundering,"" SBA said in a statement. Zug finance director Taennler said the aim set out during the meeting, which he attended, was to have a set of FINMA-approved guidelines for assessing prospective cryptocurrency clients by the year-end. FINMA has already issued separate guidelines to spell out how Swiss AML rules and securities regulations apply to various ICOs. But securities rules are less stringent in Switzerland than in the United States, where the Securities and Exchange Commission has toughened its stance on ICOs.  This makes it more risky for banks in Switzerland to be involved with ICO projects which may have raised money from U.S. contributors and could fall under the purview of the SEC.

"    When you were a young'un, your parents may have sat you down   to talk about the ""birds and the bees."" Now it's time to turn the   tables and address another uncomfortable topic: their   finances. Such conversations mark a reversal in the traditional   parent-child dynamic, and also can be fraught with concerns over   independence, trust and mortality. As a result, these talks often   don't happen at all, and a perceived lack of urgency is to blame,   according to a 2018 survey conducted by Wells Fargo. Roughly one-third of parents over the age of 60 say they've   never discussed later-life needs with family, including   inheritance plans, beneficiaries, important documents or   designated representatives, according to the survey. Meanwhile,   adult children worry such conversations will cause conflict or   make it seem as though they're after their parents' money.makeArticleAd(); As daunting as it may seem, it's important to have ""the talk""   about finances with your parents to help protect them from scams   and elder abuse, which cost Americans more than $36 billion each   year, according to financial services firm True Link Financial.   These conversations also ensure that a rapid-response plan is in   place in the event of disability and that there are no surprises   after your parents die, says Ron Long, head of regulatory affairs   and elder client initiatives at Wells Fargo Advisors. These four tips can open lines of communication. 1. Start with one conversation When's a good time to sit your parents down for a hard   conversation about their financial well-being, plans for the   future and important legal and financial documents like a will,   power of attorney or health care directives? The twelfth of   never, for most children. Don't wait for tragedy to strike. A study by Ameriprise   Financial found that a life-altering incident was the trigger for   90% of children who'd actually discussed estate planning with   their parents.  » Unfamiliar with estate planning?     See our   7-step checklist  Instead, carve out time for a family meeting - perhaps on   Mother's Day, Father's Day or the Friday after Thanksgiving -   when all the children are present, Long recommends. ""It's a good   way to get the conversation started and then you can do a   refresher or update down the road."" The first conversation should serve as a door-opener. There   are weighty decisions at play - which may change over time with   your parents' mental or physical health - so don't expect a   one-and-done conversation. 2. Begin with the basics Talking about money inspires reactions ranging from secretive   to forthright. Even if your parents aren't particularly prickly   about discussing their finances, it's prudent to ease into such   conversations. Long says a strategy that's ""very helpful"" is approaching   discussions from a group-planning perspective - sharing what   end-of-life goals you're considering and asking your parents   about theirs. ""Remember, these are subjects that a lot of older   folks hold close to their hearts,"" he says. Be sensitive when starting that initial conversation. Think   less interrogative (how much money's at stake and who gets what?)   and more collaborative (exchanging information about where   accounts are held or who has power of attorney). 3. Broach serious topics Once you've established a rapport, tackle topics that make   either you or your parents uncomfortable, including the morose   (funeral arrangements or declining health) and the dangerous   (financial scams targeting seniors that could wipe out their   savings). Don't let the prospect of an awkward conversation now create a   bigger headache in the future. Strive for this balance:   confronting reality head-on without infantilizing or offending   your parents. A bad way to deal? Shutting down future   conversations when talks are strained. A better way to deal?   Involving other family members to facilitate discussion or   working with a financial advisor to handle trickier topics.

You're asking them to part   with sensitive information; promise a judgment-free zone in   return. Because of the prevalence of financial abuse - it's estimated   one in five elders have been impacted - urge your parents to flag   potential scams.

"    The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a shock weekly build as domestic output hit 11 million barrels a day for the very first time. Despite the record production, U.S. benchmark crude futures gained 1% (or 68 cents) to $68.76 per barrel Wednesday. The positive price movement was supported by strong demand for refined product inventories.  Soaring U.S. Output  The talking point from the data sets was the steady trend of rising domestic oil production. Pumping at the rate of 11 million barrels per day, output in the United States is now ahead of Saudi Arabia and second only to Russia. Not surprisingly, a number of companies involved in oil production have generated handsome returns year to date. Stocks like Marathon Oil Corporation MRO  , Hess Corporation HES  , Anadarko Petroleum Corporation APC  and ConocoPhillips COP  have each gained in excess of 20% in 2018.  Analysis of the EIA Data    Crude Oil:   The federal government's EIA report revealed that crude inventories jumped by 5.8 million barrels for the week ending Jul 13, following a steep decrease of 12.6 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts - the leading independent commodities and energy data provider - had expected crude stocks to go down some 3 million barrels. Record high domestic production and sharp rise in imports led to the surprise stockpile build with the world's biggest oil consumer. In particular, output in the United States rose by 100,000 barrels per day last week to 11 million barrels per day - the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. In early February, oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold for the first time in nearly 50 years and has maintained the record levels thereafter. Despite last week's increase, oil inventories have generally trended lower in a year and a half. In fact, stockpiles have shrunk in 45 of the last 67 weeks and are down nearly 80 million barrels in the past year. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 411.1 million barrels, current crude supplies are 16% below the year-ago figure and 2% under the five-year average. Importantly, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma - the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange - fell 860,000 barrels to 24.9 million barrels. The crude supply cover was up from 22.9 days in the previous week to 23.4 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 28.7 days.   Gasoline:   Gasoline supplies were down for the third week on stronger demand. The 3.2 million barrels draw - above the polled number of one million barrels fall in supply level - took gasoline stockpiles down to 235.8 million barrels. Following last week's decline, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product is now 2% above the year-earlier level and is 5% over the five-year range.   Distillate:   Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) edged down 371,000 barrels last week. Meanwhile, analysts expected the supply level to decrease by 45,000 barrels. The first fall in five weeks could be attributed to higher demand. At 121.3 million barrels, current supplies are 20% below the year-ago level and 13% lower than the five-year average.   Refinery Rates:   Refinery utilization was down by 2.4% from the prior week to 94.3%.  About the Weekly Petroleum Status Report  The Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad. The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current  oil prices  and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.  Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?

"   makeZacksArticleAd();Trump's accusation that China had sought to obtain American technology through unfair means created quite an uproar, breaking out a trade war.Many analysts opine that the U.S. energy market won't be able to withstand the war blows for long since Beijing is now a key destination for massive volumes of American oil shipments. However, if China hits back with tariffs on U.S. oil and petroleum products, the losses for U.S. energy companies are likely to be limited, considering that more than 75% of petroleum consumed by the Americans come from the domestic market itself.Sino-US Trade War Heats UpWith the recent threat from the Trump administration of 10% tariffs on additional $200 billion Chinese exports, the Sino-US trade war has intensified. The first salvo was fired on Jul 6 when the United States slapped 25% tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods. If the second round of tariffs kicks in, the export sector of China will face a severe blow.China exports the largest share of its goods to the United Sates. If the Trump administration proceeds with imposing duties on more Chinese goods, almost 50% of U.S. imports from Beijing will be under duties, according to Rajiv Biswas of IHS Markit.Tension Grips US EnergyChina struck back last time by levying duties on equivalent value of goods from the United States. Beijing can now resort to the same tactic again by imposing tariffs on U.S. oil products if further duties are levied by the United States.The export market of U.S. energy products heavily relies on China. In fact, China imported the second highest volumes of American crude after Canada through 2017, per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) . China was also the third largest buyer of propane and liquefied natural gas from the United States, according to EIA data.If China levies duties on U.S. petroleum products, there will be a pressing need for American explorers and integrated players to search for another prospective buyer which entails the loss of both time and money.How to Cash in on the Situation?In 2017, the United States consumed 19.9 million barrels (MMb/D) of petroleum a day. Out of the total volumes consumed, almost 77% - 15.3 MMb/D - was produced in the domestic market, significantly higher than 6.3 MMb/D exported last year, per EIA data.Clearly, American players generate negligible revenues from exporting petroleum as compared to selling it in the U.S. market. Hence, if China - accounting for 7% of the total U.S. petroleum exports in 2017 - imposes tariffs on American oil, the domestic energy firms will have to bear limited losses keeping the booming domestic market in mind.The yields of the Treasury notes and bonds rose after Jerome Powell testified in front of the Congress, reflecting strong investor confidence in the market. The chair of the Federal Reserve said that as compared to just 2% economic growth through the January-to-March quarter of 2018, the U.S. economy grew at a much faster pace in second-quarter 2018.  Which Stocks to Buy?With the expectation that the booming domestic market will continue to favor U.S. energy firms, it might be a wise decision to invest in companies contributing to the oil and natural gas output in America. Also, since some U.S. shale plays - especially the Permian Basin - are facing pipeline bottleneck problems, it will be better to invest in companies operating in areas where the number of drilled but uncompleted wells (DUC) are declining.Per EIA, in the Niobrara region, the number of DUC wells fell by 42 through the month of June. However, in the Permian, the DUC wells increased by 164 over the same time span.Picking winning stocks with strong foothold in the Niobrara region may be a daunting task. This is where our  VGM Score  comes in handy. Here, V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum, and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score.We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a solid VGM Score and Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .Headquartered in The Woodlands, TX, Anadarko Petroleum CorporationAPC currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.

"    Canadian oil and natural gas producer Encana Corporation ECA  is expected to release second-quarter 2018 results around Friday, Jul 20. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 9 cents per share on revenues of $1,130 million. In the preceding three-month period, the company reported operating earnings per share of 16 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 13 cents. Increased liquids production along with higher price realizations drove the outperformance  . As far as earnings surprises are concerned, the Calgary, Alberta-based upstream operator is on a solid footing, having gone past the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the last four reports. This is depicted in the graph below:   Encana Corporation Price and EPS Surprise          Encana Corporation Price and EPS Surprise    |      Encana Corporation Quote  Investors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that Encana surpasses earnings estimate this time too. However, our model indicates that the company might not beat on earnings this time around. Let's delve deep to find out the factors likely to impact Encana's second-quarter results.  Factors to Consider This Quarter  We believe that the improving oil price environment amid a favorable shift in Encana's product mix toward the commodity bode well. Few years back, natural gas accounted for around 95% of Encana's output. In the last reported quarter, the figure came down to 55%, chiefly due to a slew of acquisitions and divestitures since 2013 that has repositioned its asset base. The transition to crude - which are generally more profitable to churn out than natural gas because of higher price realizations - is a big positive for the company going into the second quarter. As it is, benchmark crude  oil prices  have risen sharply over the past year. At the end of the second quarter, oil was trading at around $74 per barrel - in a sweet spot compared to the corresponding period of 2017 when crude futures hovered around the $46 per barrel mark. However, creeping service cost inflation remain an issue as rising prices might reduce profit margin.  What Does Our Model Say?  Our proven model too does not conclusively show that Encana will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat consensus estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter  . That is not the case here as you will see below.   Zacks ESP:   Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -23.91%.  Zacks Rank:  Encana is #2 Ranked. Though a Zacks Rank of 2 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.  Stocks to Consider  While earnings beat looks uncertain for Encana, here are some firms from the energy space you may want to consider on the basis of our model, which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter: ConocoPhillips COP  has an Earnings ESP of +10.78% and a Zacks Rank #1. The firm is expected to release earnings on Jul 26. You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here   . Anadarko Petroleum Corporation APC  has an Earnings ESP of +15.52% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is likely to release earnings on Jul 31. Newfield Exploration Company NFX  has an Earnings ESP of +1.16% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is anticipated to release earnings on Jul 31.  Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies  It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%. And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

"    We expect Halliburton Company HAL  to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2018 results on Monday, Jul 23, before market opens. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is a profit of 59 cents on revenues of $6,110 million. In the preceding three-month period, the major oilfield service provider delivered an in-line quarter as robust North American drilling activity on the back of oil pricing strength were offset by problems in Venezuela and frack sand delivery delays. On a further encouraging note, Halliburton has an incredible history when it comes to beating earnings estimates. Investors should note that Halliburton hasn't missed earnings estimates since mid-2014, as you can see in the chart below:   Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise          Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise    |      Halliburton Company Quote  Even pricewise, while the shares are down 7.8% so far this year, the drop is less than the collective loss of 9.2% for the stocks in this industry  .      Investors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that Houston, TX-based provider of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells surpasses earnings estimate this time too. Thankfully, as per our model, the trend is likely to be maintained in the second quarter. Evidently, multiple tailwinds have buoyed expectations for world's second-largest oilfield services company after Schlumberger SLB  .  Why a Likely Positive Surprise?  Our proven model shows that Halliburton is likely to beat earnings in the to-be-reported quarter as it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat consensus estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter  .   Zacks ESP:   Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +0.14%. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise.  Zacks Rank:  Halliburton is #3 Ranked which, when combined with a positive ESP, makes us confident of earnings beat.  We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.  What is Driving the Better-Than-Expected   Earnings?  With crude prices having gone up and stabilized, investment in drilling activities (especially in North American shale) are on the rise. Halliburton, owning bulk of the North American shale drilling market, should be the prime beneficiary of this trend. As a result, the company's earnings and cash flows are likely to remain robust in coming quarters. In particular, Halliburton's premier position in the prolific Permian Basin - which is experiencing a huge ramp up in production growth - will ensure improving returns. As a proof of the resurgence in activities, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter Completion and Production revenue is pegged at $4,105 million, higher than $3,807 million reported in the previous quarter and significantly above the second-quarter 2017 sales of $3,132 million. To put things in perspective, the Completion and Production unit makes up around two-thirds of the oilfield service provider's total revenue and operating income.  Other Stocks to Consider  Halliburton is not the only energy firm looking up this earnings season. Here are some companies from the space which, according to our model, also have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter. ConocoPhillips COP  has an Earnings ESP of +10.78% and a Zacks Rank #1. The firm is expected to release earnings on Jul 26. You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank   (Strong Buy) stocks here   . Anadarko Petroleum Corporation APC  has an Earnings ESP of +15.52% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is anticipated to release earnings on Jul 31.  Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?

"We measure investing wins and losses by how a stock performs   against the broader market, with most benchmarking against the   S&P 500    . While many investors assume that high-octane growth stocks give   them the best chance to earn market-beating returns,   dividend growth stocks    have trounced their nonpaying peers over the last several   decades. According to a study by Ned Davis Research, companies that   increased their dividends on a consistent basis have delivered a   total annual return of nearly 10.1% going all the way back to   1972. That has not only outpaced the S&P 500's 7.7% yearly   total return over that time frame, but also the paltry 2.6%   average annual gain of nonpayers. Given that data, it would behoove investors to focus more on   finding companies poised to grow their dividends at a healthy   pace, since that would theoretically provide them with more fuel   to outperform. That's why investors won't want to miss what oil   driller   EOG Resources    (NYSE: EOG) has on tap. While its paltry 0.6%-yielding dividend   might not appeal to income investors, its dividend growth   prospects have the potential to continue fueling market-smashing   returns.makeArticleAd();   Image source: Getty Images. A jaw-dropping dividend growth history EOG Resources has quietly been one of the better dividend   growth stocks since it began paying one in early 1998. From that   starting point, the oil giant has increased its payout at a   remarkable 19% compound annual growth rate, boosting it a   stunning 2,366% overall. That rapidly growing income stream has   richly rewarded investors by fueling an equally impressive total   return of 2,620% over that time frame, which has pulverized the   305% total return generated by the S&P 500. However, like most oil stocks, EOG Resources lacked the fuel   to grow its dividend during the industry's most recent downturn.   Because of that, the company pressed the pause button on dividend   growth in 2015. While that ended a 16-year streak of consecutive   dividend increases, it could have been far worse. Many of its peers slashed or eliminated their dividends to   preserve cash. Former dividend stalwarts   ConocoPhillips    (NYSE: COP) and   Anadarko Petroleum    (NYSE: APC) were among the many that caved under the pressure of   lower    oil   prices    , with ConocoPhillips slicing its payout by two-thirds, while   Anadarko slashed its dividend by 82%. Reset and ready to hit the accelerator By preserving cash during the industry's dark days, and making   changes to drive down costs, oil companies are in a position to   begin returning more money to shareholders now that market   conditions are on the upswing. ConocoPhillips has already   increased its payout 14% in the last two years, while Anadarko   jacked its dividend up fivefold, putting it within striking   distance of its former peak. EOG, meanwhile, restarted dividend   growth this year by raising its payout 10.4%. That increase is only the beginning for EOG Resources. The oil   driller repositioned its business to thrive as long as oil   remains above $50 a barrel. At that price point, the company can   generate enough cash flow to fund its current dividend and invest   in drilling the new wells needed to grow its U.S. oil production   at a more than 15% compound annual growth rate. That oil-fueled   growth would expand cash flow at an even greater pace. Meanwhile,   with crude currently near $70 a barrel, EOG is in position to   produce a significant windfall of excess cash going forward. Because of that, EOG believes it can grow its dividend at an   accelerated pace    . In fact, it aims to increase the payout at a greater than 19%   compound annual growth rate going forward, which is the pace it   has kept up since 1999. That higher-octane dividend growth could   provide EOG with the fuel it needs to continue delivering   market-smashing returns. This factor yields a higher return in the long run Most dividend investors focus on stocks with higher yields   because they want to generate more income now. As a result,   they'll likely take one look at EOG Resources' paltry   0.6%-yielding payout and toss it aside. That approach, however,   can cause them to miss out on an even bigger payday, which is   what EOG has provided its investors over the years with its   fast-paced dividend growth. That's why investors won't want to   miss the fact that this oil giant is about to hit the accelerator   on dividend growth, which could be its ticket to delivering   continued outperformance.   10 stocks we like better than EOG Resources       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

"     For Immediate Release  Chicago, IL -July 18, 2018 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include ConocoPhillips COP  , Anadarko Petroleum APC  ,  Occidental Petroleum OXY  , GulfMark Offshore, Inc. GLF  and QEP Resources, Inc. QEP  .  Here are highlights from Tuesday's Analyst Blog:    Oil & Gas Stock Roundup: COP, APC, OXY and More   It was a week where both oil and natural gas finished lower. On the news front, oil biggies ConocoPhillips  and Anadarko Petroleum  authorized additions to their stock repurchase programs. Meanwhile, Occidental Petroleum  recently increased its dividend. Overall, it wasn't a good week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost 3.8% to close at $71.01 per barrel,  natural gas prices  fell around 3.7% to $2.752 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last 'Oil & Gas Stock Roundup' here: Enbridge's Midstream Sale, Chevron's North Sea Plans & More  ) The U.S. crude benchmark slipped for the second week in a row even as the Energy Department's inventory release showed that stockpiles recorded its largest weekly draw since 2016. The massive 12.6 million barrels dip pushed storage levels to their lowest since February 2015, while keeping them under the five-year average. However, the positive reading was more than offset by fears of supply resumption from Libya and escalating trade conflict between the United States and China. Meanwhile, natural gas prices also moved southward last week as bearish weather predictions pointed to weakening demand and pressured the fuel's price. Investors were spooked by forecasts of lower-than-normal temperature that could lead to decrease in natural gas demand for air-conditioning.  Recap of the Week's Most Important Stories  1.    ConocoPhillips has received consent from board of directors for increasing share repurchase program for 2018 by 50% to $3 billion from $2 billion. In 2018, the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company will have sufficient cash from operations to fund the program along with dividend and capital expenditures. You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here   . Currently, the company has a total share repurchase authorization of $6 billion. The 2018 share repurchase program expansion to $3 billion along with shares repurchased worth $3 billion during 2016 and 2017, will fully utilize the board's existing authorization. Therefore, the board has authorized additional share repurchases of $9 billion, taking the total amount to $15 billion.

The authorization indicates the company's plan to utilize free cash flow to fund repurchase and repayment of debts. Anadarko Petroleum has been undertaking initiatives to create value for shareholders. On Jun 29, 2018, the company completed its previous $3-billion share repurchase authorization. The recent authorization created another coffer of $1 billion for shares to be repurchased before the end of June 2019. The current debt/capital ratio of the company is 57.09%, which is higher than the industry average of 35.05%. Anadarko Petroleum had a plan to redeem debts worth $1 billion in the near term.

The figure reflects a 1.3% hike compared with the previous annual rate of $3.08 per share. The board members of Occidental Petroleum have been clearing annual dividend hikes for more than a decade now. Notably, yearly payout increases are becoming a steady policy for this Oil and Gas major. The company's latest move marks the 16th consecutive year of dividend raise. The current annualized dividend yield is 3.7% compared with the S&P 500 average of 1.8%. This rise in distributable income vouches for the company's strong balance sheet and a constant cash flow position, providing it with financial flexibility and a cushion for incremental dividend.

Per the agreement, Tidewater will purchase GulfMark by paying about $340 million to create a combined company worth about $1.25 billion in an all-stock deal. GulfMark's shareholders will get 1.100 shares of Tidewater common stock for each share. Subject to Jones Act restrictions on maximum ownership of shares by non-U.S. citizens, GulfMark noteholder warrant will be automatically changed into the right to receive 1.100 Tidewater shares.

The combined company will possess the industry's largest fleet as well as extensive coverage globally in the OSV sector. It will operate 102 Tier 1 vessels, of which 20 are stacked currently, with an average age of about 6.5 years.

"Reuters  @media screen and (max-device-width: 480px){body{ font-size:30pt !important;}}    By Anna Irrera and Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi NEW YORK/ZURICH, July 19 (Reuters) - Swiss regulators are stepping up efforts to halt an exodus of cryptocurrency projects from the country, after two of only a handful of banks active in the nascent sector shut their doors on it in the last year. The departures, which industry sources fear will continue, mean Switzerland is losing business to offshore rivals including Liechtenstein, Gibraltar and the Cayman Islands, where banks are more welcoming.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','',''); The wealthy Swiss canton of Zug, for example, has been dubbed ""Crypto Valley"", with 200-300 virtual currency entities opening there in recent years. Zug's finance director, Heinz Taennler, says they may leave if the government does not take steps to give them access to the banking system, without which they struggle to function. ""All their banking relationships are going to Liechtenstein,"" he told Reuters. ""These are hundreds of jobs that have been created, and every job is important."" Thomas Moser, an alternate member of the governing board at the Swiss National Bank (SNB), said some cryptocurrency companies had asked the central to intervene. ""They raised concerns about problems with opening bank accounts, which was a worry for them, and asked for help,"" Moser told Reuters. ""I said this was not something the SNB dealt with, but they should speak with FINMA. FINMA, Switzerland's financial market supervisor, has held discussions with the SNB and bankers' association on how to make banks more accessible to cryptocurrency ventures. ""We would not want to close the door on the opportunities that such innovation (cryptocurrencies) might bring,"" Moser added. Providing the legal framework to launch ICOs and for banks to do business with cryptocurrency companies is not easy. The risk of fraud and lack of transparency about who owns cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether have made regulators around the world wary. The United States is among countries that are increasing scrutiny of the sector.   BANKS WARY Swiss banks are urging the authorities to give them more clarity on the rules that apply to cryptocurrency projects before providing services to the market, and at least two important players have withdrawn for now. Zuercher Kantonalbank (ZKB), the fourth largest Swiss bank and one of the few big banks in the world to welcome issuers of cryptocurrencies, has closed the accounts of more than 20 companies in the last year, industry sources told Reuters. A spokesman for ZKB declined to comment on any former or existing clients relationships, but said the bank does not do business with any cryptocurrency groups. Another large Swiss bank kicked out crypto project Smart Valor at around the same time, said a person familiar with the project. The source declined to name the bank. Only a handful of Switzerland's 250 banks ever allowed companies to deposit the cash equivalent of cryptocurrencies raised in ICOs. At least two still do, Reuters has established. But the involvement of a large bank like ZKB helped to establish Switzerland as an early cryptocurrency hub. ZKB and the bank that turned its back on Smart Valor began shutting their doors in October after a management feud severely damaged cryptocurrency project Tezos, which had conducted Zug's largest ICO, entrepreneurs and advisers said.  Swiss banks are worried because some companies that carried out ICOs did not do anti-money laundering (AML) checks on their contributors, industry sources said. This means the banks themselves could fall foul of AML rules.   LIECHTENSTEIN A WINNER ""A cautionary response from Swiss banks resulted in a pause or closure for most projects in the cryptocurrency space,""  said David Henderson, founder of the Swiss Sweetbridge Foundation, set up to conduct blockchain startup Sweetbridge's ICO. Sweetbridge was in the late stages of securing an account with ZKB, but the application was put on hold a few days after the Tezos scandal erupted, Henderson said. The project ultimately decided not to carry out its planned ICO through the Swiss foundation, setting up entities and bank accounts in Gibraltar and Liechtenstein instead. It is difficult for crypto-projects to use the funds they raise through ICOs if they are locked out of the banking system. Funds from ICOs are often originally raised in cryptocurrencies bitcoin and ether, which have limited use as a means of payment in the broader economy. ""I cannot pay salaries because our money is caught up there. We cannot move it,"" said the founder of a Swiss crypto-firm which has had accounts closed at three different banks. The banks have asked the firm to take out its money, but it is unable to do so without first finding another banking relationship, the founder added. At least two Swiss banks are still accepting ICO funds, according to checks by Reuters. These are Banca Zarattini, a small bank in the Italian-language canton Ticino, and Hypothekarbank Lenzburg, a regional lender located between Zurich and Basel, which recently began accepting crypto customers. Banca Zarattini only banks ICO companies with KYC (know-your-customer) and AML procedures that are in compliance with Swiss law, it said. Hypothekarbank Lenzburg said it had started to accept crytocurrency companies and could charge an initial assessment fee of up to 2,500 Swiss francs($2,500). Bank Frick in Liechtenstein has become a popular alternative for Swiss entities struggling to secure accounts. It banks around 160 crypto-enterprises or projects, of which 60 are in the process of setting up an ICO, the bank told Reuters. The bank, however, declined 90 percent of account requests from cryptocurrency companies and only accepts ICOs based onshore in Switzerland or Liechtenstein, it said.   RULES AND REASSURANCES Despite the challenges, Switzerland is working on new rules to reassure banks and encourage them to accept the accounts of cryptocurrency companies. The country has dropped from second place in 2017 to sixth this year in a country ranking of the sum of ICO funds raised,  according to a study published by PwC and the Crypto Valley Association in June. The Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands topped the list. In May, Swiss Finance Minister Ueli Maurer invited FINMA, the central bank and the Swiss Bankers Association (SBA) to a roundtable discussion on bank accounts for cryptocurrencies. After the meeting, the SBA set up a working group to compile a set of checks and conditions that all banks could follow when opening an account for cryptocurrency firms. ""Banks are currently hesitant to open business accounts for companies with particular touchpoints to ICOs and cryptocurrencies - due to risks such as fraud or money laundering,"" SBA said in a statement. Zug finance director Taennler said the aim set out during the meeting, which he attended, was to have a set of FINMA-approved guidelines for assessing prospective cryptocurrency clients by the year-end. FINMA has already issued separate guidelines to spell out how Swiss AML rules and securities regulations apply to various ICOs. But securities rules are less stringent in Switzerland than in the United States, where the Securities and Exchange Commission has toughened its stance on ICOs.  This makes it more risky for banks in Switzerland to be involved with ICO projects which may have raised money from U.S. contributors and could fall under the purview of the SEC. Switzerland's authorities have said they want to create conditions for the country to remain competitive but with no room for scams or financial crime. The finance ministry is also looking at the broader legal framework for blockchain technology and ICOs. Its findings will be presented to the federal government by the end of the year and will determine how the technology fits into existing Swiss laws and regulations.

"    When you were a young'un, your parents may have sat you down   to talk about the ""birds and the bees."" Now it's time to turn the   tables and address another uncomfortable topic: their   finances. Such conversations mark a reversal in the traditional   parent-child dynamic, and also can be fraught with concerns over   independence, trust and mortality. As a result, these talks often   don't happen at all, and a perceived lack of urgency is to blame,   according to a 2018 survey conducted by Wells Fargo. Roughly one-third of parents over the age of 60 say they've   never discussed later-life needs with family, including   inheritance plans, beneficiaries, important documents or   designated representatives, according to the survey. Meanwhile,   adult children worry such conversations will cause conflict or   make it seem as though they're after their parents' money.makeArticleAd(); As daunting as it may seem, it's important to have ""the talk""   about finances with your parents to help protect them from scams   and elder abuse, which cost Americans more than $36 billion each   year, according to financial services firm True Link Financial.   These conversations also ensure that a rapid-response plan is in   place in the event of disability and that there are no surprises   after your parents die, says Ron Long, head of regulatory affairs   and elder client initiatives at Wells Fargo Advisors. These four tips can open lines of communication. 1. Start with one conversation When's a good time to sit your parents down for a hard   conversation about their financial well-being, plans for the   future and important legal and financial documents like a will,   power of attorney or health care directives? The twelfth of   never, for most children. Don't wait for tragedy to strike. A study by Ameriprise   Financial found that a life-altering incident was the trigger for   90% of children who'd actually discussed estate planning with   their parents.  » Unfamiliar with estate planning?     See our   7-step checklist  Instead, carve out time for a family meeting - perhaps on   Mother's Day, Father's Day or the Friday after Thanksgiving -   when all the children are present, Long recommends. ""It's a good   way to get the conversation started and then you can do a   refresher or update down the road."" The first conversation should serve as a door-opener. There   are weighty decisions at play - which may change over time with   your parents' mental or physical health - so don't expect a   one-and-done conversation. 2. Begin with the basics Talking about money inspires reactions ranging from secretive   to forthright. Even if your parents aren't particularly prickly   about discussing their finances, it's prudent to ease into such   conversations. Long says a strategy that's ""very helpful"" is approaching   discussions from a group-planning perspective - sharing what   end-of-life goals you're considering and asking your parents   about theirs. ""Remember, these are subjects that a lot of older   folks hold close to their hearts,"" he says. Be sensitive when starting that initial conversation. Think   less interrogative (how much money's at stake and who gets what?)   and more collaborative (exchanging information about where   accounts are held or who has power of attorney). 3. Broach serious topics Once you've established a rapport, tackle topics that make   either you or your parents uncomfortable, including the morose   (funeral arrangements or declining health) and the dangerous   (financial scams targeting seniors that could wipe out their   savings). Don't let the prospect of an awkward conversation now create a   bigger headache in the future. Strive for this balance:   confronting reality head-on without infantilizing or offending   your parents. A bad way to deal? Shutting down future   conversations when talks are strained. A better way to deal?   Involving other family members to facilitate discussion or   working with a financial advisor to handle trickier topics. (Here   are some tips on   choosing a financial advisor    .) 4. Leave judgment at the door Conversations with your parents may reveal wildly different   opinions about how to handle finances. You're asking them to part   with sensitive information; promise a judgment-free zone in   return. Because of the prevalence of financial abuse - it's estimated   one in five elders have been impacted - urge your parents to flag   potential scams. Avoid shaming them for ill-advised financial   decisions or falling victim to fraud. Instead, focus on   prevention, via routine communication about finances and keeping   documents accurate and up-to-date.

There   are weighty decisions at play - which may change over time with   your parents' mental or physical health - so don't expect a   one-and-done conversation. 2. Begin with the basics Talking about money inspires reactions ranging from secretive   to forthright. Even if your parents aren't particularly prickly   about discussing their finances, it's prudent to ease into such   conversations. Long says a strategy that's ""very helpful"" is approaching   discussions from a group-planning perspective - sharing what   end-of-life goals you're considering and asking your parents   about theirs. ""Remember, these are subjects that a lot of older   folks hold close to their hearts,"" he says. Be sensitive when starting that initial conversation. Think   less interrogative (how much money's at stake and who gets what?)   and more collaborative (exchanging information about where   accounts are held or who has power of attorney). 3. Broach serious topics Once you've established a rapport, tackle topics that make   either you or your parents uncomfortable, including the morose   (funeral arrangements or declining health) and the dangerous   (financial scams targeting seniors that could wipe out their   savings). Don't let the prospect of an awkward conversation now create a   bigger headache in the future. Strive for this balance:   confronting reality head-on without infantilizing or offending   your parents. A bad way to deal? Shutting down future   conversations when talks are strained. A better way to deal?   Involving other family members to facilitate discussion or   working with a financial advisor to handle trickier topics. (Here   are some tips on   choosing a financial advisor    .) 4. Leave judgment at the door Conversations with your parents may reveal wildly different   opinions about how to handle finances. You're asking them to part   with sensitive information; promise a judgment-free zone in   return. Because of the prevalence of financial abuse - it's estimated   one in five elders have been impacted - urge your parents to flag   potential scams. Avoid shaming them for ill-advised financial   decisions or falling victim to fraud. Instead, focus on   prevention, via routine communication about finances and keeping   documents accurate and up-to-date.

"    On Tuesday, Walmart WMT  revealed that it has entered a five-year deal with Microsoft MSFT  which will allow the retail giant to use the tech firm's cloud solutions, such as Azure and 365. The agreement will also see the two companies take part in new projects centered on machine learning, artificial, intelligence, and data platforms. For Walmart, the deal is an obvious move to fight back against Amazon AMZN  , the company's biggest competition in the retail space. The partnership will significantly bolster Walmart's online operations as the retailer embarks on a critical digital transformation to combat Amazon's e-commerce success. Use of Microsoft's cloud infrastructure will also make shopping faster for Walmart's customers and help to streamline the retail giant's supply chain through data integration.  Significance for Microsoft  While the partnership is a major breakthrough for Walmart for obvious reasons, it is equally essential for Microsoft and the tech company's growth moving forward. For starters, Amazon is also Microsoft's main rival-but in the cloud computing space. Amazon's cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services, has a $20 billion annual revenue run rate and is the current market leader, with Microsoft actually trailing behind it in second place. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella didn't shy away at all from that rivalry, stating that its ""absolutely core to this"" new partnership with Walmart, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal  . Partnering with Walmart will expand use of Microsoft's cloud service into the retail industry, and the company could potentially push even more retailers to use its tech capabilities in the future. Amazon has already made deals with retailers like Kohl's KSS  , so teaming up with Walmart was nearly a move Microsoft had to make. In addition, this isn't the first initiative Microsoft has taken to counter Amazon. Microsoft has recently been developing technology  that will take away cashiers and checkout lines from stores, a clear response to Amazon's already existent automated grocery shop Amazon Go. The partnership with Walmart also wasn't the only deal that Microsoft has made to spread the use of its cloud services. On Monday, the company announced another major partnership, this time with GE GE  , which will integrate Microsoft's cloud features into GE's Predix portfolio.  Bottom line  Microsoft is on a clear mission to defeat Amazon and broaden its cloud business. The company is taking steps to accomplish those goals by strategically entering partnerships and digitally transforming high-valued companies and industry leaders.  Microsoft stock  has seen a huge rise in recent years, which can be partly attributed to cloud-based growth. In this year alone the stock has risen 45%, and the stock even traded on Tuesday at a record high of $106.50 per share.  Microsoft is set to report earnings on July 19, and these results will be a key sign as to whether the company can compete with Amazon and evolve into the cloud-computing leader moving forward.

"When   Amazon    (NASDAQ: AMZN) bought the Whole Foods grocery chain, it picked up   an asset that added a brick-and-mortar presence to an important   part of its business. The   $13.7 billion    deal gave the online retailer a platform to expand its grocery   delivery business while also adding distribution for its consumer   electronics products. The company did not tap into any of its cash reserves to close   that deal. Instead, it borrowed the money on a long-term basis.   That was a surprising decision, but it gives the company added   flexibility to make another deal. Amazon closed 2017 with over $30 billion in cash, cash   equivalents, and short-term investments. That puts the company in   position to make another major deal easily and quickly. The   logical contender for the company to spend its cash hoard on   would be a retailer it's already partnered with:   Kohl's    (NYSE: KSS) .makeArticleAd();   Amazon already has a presence in some Kohl's stores. Image     source: Kohl's. Why Kohl's? Amazon and Kohl's are already   working together    on a limited basis. The brick-and-mortar chain accepts Amazon   returns in a select number of its stores, and those locations   also have store-within-a-store concepts selling the online   retailer's consumer electronics line. That deal is useful, but expanding it is not the main reason   Amazon could buy Kohl's. It would make more sense for the online   retailer to purchase the physical chain to market its growing   number of private-label clothing lines as well as its   private-label furniture. These products would fit well into the Kohl's lineup and help   the retailer compete when it comes to price. It would also allow   customers considering buying clothing from Amazon to see it in   person, and even try it on. That should accelerate acceptance of   these lines, which would increase their sales on Amazon.com. Kohl's, which has shrunk some of its stores, could use its   excess space to support Amazon's delivery efforts. That could   include grocery delivery or acting as mini-warehouses. Could it happen? Kohl's had a market cap of roughly $11.6 billion on July 13.   It paid a 27% premium for Whole Foods over the price it was   trading at the day before the sale was announced. You can argue that Whole Foods was a struggling company at the   time of its purchase, and that Kohl's is currently in better   shape. But, even if Amazon had to pay a 50% premium to close a   Kohl's deal, the online retailer has the cash to make this   happen. Will this happen? Amazon and Kohl's are in the early stages of a partnership. If   their deal expands, it could make sense for the online retailer   to make this happen. Kohl's solves multiple problems for Amazon. It gives it a   place to show off its private-label clothes and furniture, while   also giving it excess space to play with. That extra square   footage could also be used to grow its line of bookstores, or its   Amazon Go convenience stores, in addition to the reasons   mentioned above. Neither company needs to move quickly, here. Kohl's appears to   be one of the retail chains that will succeed in the current   marketplace, and Amazon obviously has no need to jump into any   deal. Still, this purchase makes a lot of sense.   10 stocks we like better than Amazon       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

"So far in 2018, shares of   J.C. Penney    (NYSE: JCP) and   Kohl's    (NYSE: KSS) have been headed in opposite directions. As of this   writing, Penney is down 24% compared with a 31% gain for Kohl's.   For two companies that are both moderate-price department stores,   that is a bewildering difference in performance. The reason is   that the future for one of these department store chains looks   much more certain. A side-by-side comparison     Metric   Kohl'smakeArticleAd();   J.C.

Chart by author. Data source: Yahoo!   Finance. Kohl's for the rebound  Department stores have been roughed up    in the last few years, and Kohl's has been no exception. Even   while overall retail sales in the U.S. have increased modestly   every year for nearly a decade, sales at the department store   chain have struggled to gain traction. Over the last three-year   stretch, revenue increased a meager 2%. That has started to change as of late, though. Total revenue   increased 2.2% in 2017, with comparable sales -- a combination of   foot traffic and average transaction size    -- increasing 6.3% during the important holiday season. That was   followed by a 3.5% year-over-year revenue increase and 3.6% rise   in comparable sales in the first quarter of 2018. Both events are   responsible for the strong performance in Kohl's stock so far   this year, as they've helped lift earnings by double digits. While management attributes the strong performance to its work   in improving digital sales capabilities and forging new   partnerships with other retailers and product suppliers, Kohl's   is also benefiting from the decline of some of its peers.   Regional chain Bon-Ton is closing, and the decline of longtime   mall anchor   Sears    is   well documented    . Thus, the story of Kohl's has been one of surviving the   competition in today's digital age.   Image source: Getty Images. J.C. Penney is treading water One of Kohl's struggling peers is none other than J.C. Penney.   Revenue hasn't budged in years, and   high expenses    have prevented the stores from turning a full-year profit since   2012. A rebound has been slowly mounting from the steep losses of   a few years ago, but progress has been slower than at Kohl's.   Revenue fell 0.3%, and comparable sales increased only 0.1% in   2017. The first quarter of 2018 was equally dismal, with revenue   decreasing 4.3% and comparable sales increasing 0.2%. It was a tough period for clothing retail, as management said   that bad weather hurt results. It thinks J.C. Penney's results   can improve through the rest of the year, though, and keep the   bottom line on the road to recovery. That's indicated by a   forward P/E of 15.1 based on analyst expectations. However, the picture for J.C. Penney got a little cloudier   late in the spring. CEO Marvin Ellison, who was tasked with the   chain's recovery mission in 2015, left to take over at   Lowe's    in May. Ellison had been working to revitalize Penney with new   sales categories like appliances, and by keeping costs in check.   Those efforts have had limited impact on total sales thus far.   However, with the company knocking on the door of profitability   once again, a change at the top presents an unknown wild card to   investors. The winner is... J.C. Penney shares have been beaten down so far this year, and   the stock has plunged more than 85% over the past five years.   Still, the company is surviving the deteriorating business   conditions that all department stores are facing. If results   improve later in the year, as management said it expects, the   stock could be long overdue for a positive bounce. However, Kohl's has managed its defense much better. Although   shares have already rallied on promising results, the stock is   more attractively priced at 12.6 times forward earnings, compared   with 15.1 at J.C. Penney. With foot traffic back on the rise and   the chain also sporting a 3.4% annual dividend, Kohl's looks like   the better buy-and-hold stock at this point.   10 stocks we like better than J.C.

"   InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSince blasting to new multi-year highs in June, retail stocks have been wrestling with overhead resistance. But opportunity lurks amid the chop.

We're skipping the weekly and moving straight to a monthly chart.Like a corpse, Kohl's shares have been stuck in a box for 18 years. To be fair, it's a big box and there has been plenty of flailing around. But, it has proven altogether unable to breakout. Is it any wonder why the recent rally was stopped cold at $79? It has been the threshold where all uptrends have gone to die.    Source: OptionsAnalytix     When or if KSS stock ever breaches this graveyard in the sky is anyone's guess. But if it does, it will likely be a breakout for the ages.With the significance of overhead resistance now firmly established, let's turn to the daily chart to see the pattern that caught my eye. It serves as the justification for today's focus on KSS.7 Hot Stocks Savvy Investors Are BuyingIn May, Kohl's shares scored a mouth-watering resistance breach that swiftly carried the shares 15% higher, since then we've seen an orderly return to the breakout point. Technicians call this a ""re-test"" as old resistance is now being tested to see if it turns into new support.It's also worth noting the 50-day moving average sits in the same area so there are multiple reasons why buyers may finally emerge to halt the price decline. If they do and KSS turns higher for another upswing, this is as good a low-risk entry as any for new bullish trades.
